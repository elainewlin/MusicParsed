  <h1>Your First Ukulele</h1>
  <h2>Ukulele reviews</h2>
  <p>If you're looking to buy your first ukulele, I recommend a cheap (~$50) soprano from Amazon. It’s a low cost investment, and shipping is convenient. Don’t go too cheap (~$30) or else quality will suffer.</p>
  <p>I’ve bought the following 2 ukes from Amazon:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Donner-Zebrawood-Ukulele-Soprano-DUS-2/dp/B072NZVKC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donner soprano</a> [recommended]
      <ol>
        <li>Excellent value. Includes carrying case, strap, clip-on tuner, and extra strings.</li>
        <li>I usually keep this one at work. Let me know if you want to borrow it.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kala-Mahogany-Soprano-Ukulele-Strings/dp/B00MCXEESW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kala KA-15S soprano</a></li>
  </ol>
  <p>I got a nicer ukulele after playing for about a year. I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kala-KA-SSTU-C-Concert-Travel-Ukulele/dp/B004Y6JY80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kala concert travel</a> ($200) from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/guitar-solo-san-francisco" target="_blank">Guitar Solo</a>. Travel ukuleles are thinner, so it’s easy to pack in luggage. The material is better, and the uke has a crisper, louder sound.</p>

  <h2>Types of ukulele</h2>
  <p>If you’re starting out, there’s no need to worry too much about the particular wood, the brand, or the strings. The differences are subtle.</p>
  <p>The biggest difference is size. There’s four main sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone. There’s also a sopranino, which is smaller than a soprano. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ukerepublic.com/shop-by-ukulele-sizes.html&sa=D&ust=1509897252285000&usg=AFQjCNH012WbMfp0WIoOPaQ9OZnYxZ6r7g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> are some more pictures of different ukulele sizes.</p>
  <img class="center-block" src="https://ukuguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ukutabs-ukulele-sizes.jpg?x30934" />
  <br />
  <p>The sizes differ in tone and tuning. Larger ukuleles are louder because there’s more space for sound to resonate.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generally, smaller ukuleles (sopranino, soprano, concert) come tuned high G, C, E, A.</li>
    <li>Tenor ukuleles tend to have a low G.</li>
    <li>Baritone ukuleles are tuned like the bottom 4 strings of a guitar: D, G, B, E.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, by switching out what strings you use, you can customize the tuning. For a deeper base tone, you could replace the high G string on the soprano with a low G.</p>
