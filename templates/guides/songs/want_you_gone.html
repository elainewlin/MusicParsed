    Start with an ukulele in standard tuning. I use an ukulele with a low G.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the picking/strum pattern I use to play Want You Gone. Click

  </p>
  <span>
    I use 2 picking/strum patterns in different sections of the song:
  </span>
  <ol>
    <li>Picking - verse</li>
    <li>Rock strum - verse, chorus</li>
  </ol>
  <span>
    The finger-string assignment is:
  </span>
  <ol>
    <li>G - thumb</li>
    <li>C - index</li>
    <li>E - middle</li>
  </ol>
  <b>1. Picking - verse</b>
  <p>
    In order to sound like the original, you will need a ukulele with a low G
    string.
  </p>
  <p>
    The picking pattern here is different for each of the chords: Bbsus#4, Ebm.
    Since you don't play the A string, you don't need to hold down a fret there.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Bbsus#4   Ebm
  A|------------------
  E|--1-1------------2-
  C|-------4----3-3---
  G|-3-3--3----3-3--3--
  </pre>
  <p>
    For Bbsus#4, hold down the chord shape 341x. The picking pattern is thumb -
    middle - thumb - middle, thumb - index.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Ebm, hold down the chord shape 332x. The picking pattern is thumb -
    index, thumb - index, thumb - middle.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each verse, there are 2 points where you don't finish the entire Ebm
    picking pattern. In the Ebm => F transition, pick the first 4 notes of the
    Ebm picking pattern, and then switch to a strum for the F chord. Similarly
    in the Ebm => D, G (transition from verse to chorus), pick the first 4
    notes, and then switch to a strum for the D and G chords. The strum pattern
    used is the rock strum, which I'll describe in the next section.
  </p>
  <b>2. Rock strum - verse, chorus</b>
  <p>
    The strum pattern used for the verse and chorus is the rock strum. A rock
    strum is characterized by an emphasis on the third beat. The verse and most
    of the chorus uses the basic rock strum.
  </p>
  <pre>
  1 2 3 4
  d   D du
  </pre>
  <p>
    For the Bm => C transition in the chorus, I play an extended rock strum. You
    can substitute the regular rock strum here. The extended rock strum I play
    is:
  </p>
  <pre>
  Bm     C
  1+2+3+4+1+2+3+4+
  d   D du ud D du
  </pre>
