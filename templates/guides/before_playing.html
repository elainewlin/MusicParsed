    make sure you hold the ukulele correctly and tune the instrument. Holding
    the ukulele correctly makes it easier to play and prevents unnecessary arm
    strain. You can see how I hold my ukulele in

    Tuning the ukulele ensures that the chords are accurate. Each string of the
    ukulele is supposed to produce a certain note. Generally, soprano and
    concert ukuleles are tuned high G, C, E, A, tenor ukuleles are tuned low G,
    C, E, A, and baritone ukuleles are tuned D, G, B, E. If you donâ€™t trust your
    ear yet, I recommend a tuner where you play the ukulele string and the tuner
    visually shows you how high/low you are.

    Sometimes, brand new ukuleles have trouble staying in tune. You will also
    have this problem when you change strings. This is normal. The strings take
    a while to settle. As you play more, the ukulele will keep its tuning
    better.
