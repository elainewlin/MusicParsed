CAPO 3
[verse]
A7no3                   Dsus4
Sentimental one without any story,
                Am7no5
Your pages are full,
                        Am7
Your age is a lie.
A7no3                       Dsus4
Tall and funny soul your daydream ain't over,
                Am7no5
Portray the land,
                        Am7
Behold your crown.

[Chorus]
A7no3      Dsus4     Am7no5
Hear the sirens calling,
Am7
Old and merry tune,
Dsus4     Am7no5
While the sailor's falling.
A7no3      Dsus4     Am7no5
Last chance to rise don't worry,
Am7       Dsus4     Am7no5
Need a lullaby to restore your glory,
                         A7no3 
To restore your glory.

[verse]
A7no3                      Dsus4
Foreign creature your gift is a burden,
                Am7no5
You were born for the stars,
                        Am7
It has shown in your cards.
A7no3                      Dsus4
Frightened being you better run but slowly,
                Am7no5
Heir to the throne,
                        Am7
With patience alone.

[bridge]
Dsus4                     Am7no5
In a million years it'll all be over.
Dsus4                     Am7no5
In a million years it'll all be over,
Till then-

[Chorus]
A7no3      Dsus4    Am7no5
Hear the sirens calling,
Am7
Old and merry tune,
Dsus4     Am7no5
While the sailor's falling,
A7no3      Dsus4     Am7no5
Last chance to rise don't worry,
         Am7         Dsus4   Am7no5
Need a lullaby to restore your glory,
A7no3 
To restore your glory.
