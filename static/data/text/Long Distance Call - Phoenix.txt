[Verse]
C                         Am G
Where to go I had no idea
F                          Am G
26.10 was the price to pay
C                                    Am G
A messed up kid with no ideas at all
                F                           Am G
I thought those 26.10 I shouldn't give 'em away

  C                                           Am G
I remember this young guy died and I took his part
       F                                      Am G
He got far too many stitches on his pretty face
             C                           Am               G
Long time to see but I always thought us two would be serious
      F                                         Am G
I was looking around town, thinking the same as you

[Chorus]
       Dm             Dm7                            
I'm far gone but your long distance call 
         F                       Dm              C
and your capital letters keep me asking for more
C
It's never been like that, it’s never been like that x2
Cmaj7 
It's never been like that, it’s never been like that ×2
       Dm             Dm7                            
I'm far gone but your long distance call 
         F                       Dm              C
and your capital letters keep me asking for more

[Verse]
C                          Am      G
Where to go I had no idea about it
F                                               Am G
Most of the people do, they're only doing just fine
C                              Am    G
I don't wanna stay in place no more, see
            F                                   Am G
Ain't doing well well well, I’m only doing just fine

C                                  Am G
Long time no see, long time no say
    F                           Am         G
Got little to tell, I don't say much but I might
C                           Am               G
Something always told me us two would be serious
F                                             Am G
I’m looking around town, thinking the same as you
