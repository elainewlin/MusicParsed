[Verse]
      F          Dm
All I am is a man
           Am               C
I want the world in my hands
                F
I hate the beach
           Dm
But I stand
        Am                            C
In California with my toes in the sand


                      F
Use the sleeves of my sweater
                Dm
Let's have an adventure
            Am                              C
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
         F                        Dm
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
             Am                  C
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
F                             Dm
  She knows what I think about
                        Am
  And what I think about

  One love, two mouths
C
  One love, one house
F                    Dm
  No shirt, no blouse

  Just us, you find out
Am                                            C
  Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about, no


[Chorus]
                F                   Dm
'Cause it's too co-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
        Am       C
For you here and now
          F                   Dm
So let me ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
          Am           C
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater


[Verse]
          F
And if I may just take your breath away
    Dm
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Am
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
C
So move to a place so far away


F
The goosebumps start to raise
Dm
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
Am
And then I watch your face
C
Put my finger on your tongue

'Cause you love the taste, yeah


[Pre-Chorus]
F
These hearts adore
Dm
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Am
Inside this place is warm
C
Outside it starts to pour...


[Chorus]
F             Dm
Coming down
                  Am
One love, two mouths
                 C
One love, one house

No shirt, no blouse
F                      Dm
Just us, you find out
                                          Am
Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about, no


[repeat 2x]
                F                   Dm
'Cause it's too co-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
        Am       C
For you here and now
          F                   Dm
So let me ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
          Am           C
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater


G
Whoa, whoa...



[Chorus]
                F                   Dm
'Cause it's too co-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
        Am       C
For you here and now
          F                   Dm
So let me ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
          Am           C
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater


         F                   Dm
It's too co-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
        Am       C
For you here and now
       F                   Dm
Let me ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-old
          Am           C
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater


         F
It's too cold,
         Dm
It's too cold
    Am
The holes of my sweater...
