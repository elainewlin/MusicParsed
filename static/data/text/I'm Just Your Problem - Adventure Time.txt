[Verse]

Em                           G
Sorry I don't treat you like a goddess
C                         G
Is that what you want me to do?
Em                              G
Sorry I don't treat you like you're perfect
    C                             G
like all your little loyal subjects do,
Em                         G
Sorry I'm not made out of sugar 
             Am             D
and I'm not sweet enough for you.
   Em                 G
Is that why you always avoid me,
         C                             G
that must be such an inconvenience to you!


[Chorus]

Em           B7 
I'm just you problem
Em            B7
I'm just you problem
             Em        B7
It's like I'm not even a person, am I?
Em            B7
I'm just your problem


[Verse]

     Em                     C               G
well, I--- shouldn't have to justify what I do
Em                      C                 G
I--- shouldn't have to prove anything to you
     Em                              Am                D
I'm sorry that I exist, I forgot what landed me on your blacklist
Em                          C                   G
I--- shouldn't have to be the one that makes up with you, so
Em     B7
why do I want to?
Em     B7
why do I want to...
