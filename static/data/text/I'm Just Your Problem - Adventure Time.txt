[Verse]

Em                           G
sorry i dont treat you like a godess
C                         G
is that what you want me to do?
Em                              G
sorry i dont treat you like your perfect
    C                             G
like all your little loyal subjects do,
Em                         G
sorry i'm not made out of sugar 
             Am             D
and i'm not sweet enough for you.
   Em                 G
is that why you always avoid me,
         C                             G
that must be such an inconvenience to you!


[Chorus]

Em           B7 
i'm just you problem
Em            B7
i'm just your problem
             Em        B7
its like i'm not even a person am i?
Em            B7
i'm just your problem


[Verse]

     Em                     C               G
well, I--- shouldnt have to justify what i do
Em                      C                 G
I--- shouldnt have to prove anything to you
     Em                              Am                D
i'm sorry that i exist, i forgot what landed me on your blacklist
Em                          C                   G
I--- shouldnt have to be the one that makes up with you, so
Em     B7
why do i want to?
Em     B7
why do i want to...
