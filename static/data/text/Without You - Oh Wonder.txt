  G
Step out into the sun
  Em7
Skies above they radiate me
 Bm
Lift up, carry the love
         D
Do you know?
     G
That I've been out of my mind
  Em7
This slow life I'm waiting for you
     Bm
To swing me all of your line
         D
Do you know?
[Pre-Chorus]

                         G
Since I've been walking solo
                   Em7
Dreaming you were back home
                Bm
Hifi getting down low
              D
Hide until tomorrow
                    G
Come back into the good life
                 Em7
Lose these hazy love lies
                   Bm
I've been chasing my mind
               D
Lonely in the cold nights
[Chorus]

                       G
Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
                    Em7
Can't pick up the phone without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
                      G
And I'm digging down holes without you
               Em7
Can't be on my own without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
[Verse 2]

  G
Step out into the dark
  Em7
Where were you when I was trying
    Bm
To lift up, carry the love
         D
Do you know?
     G
That I've been closing my eyes
 Em7
Love me slow, hallucinating
  Bm
Swinging me all of your light
         D
Do you know?
[Pre-Chorus]

                         G
Since I've been walking solo
                   Em7
Dreaming you were back home
                Bm
Hifi getting down low
              D
Hide until tomorrow
                    G
Come back into the good life
                 Em7
Lose these hazy love lies
                   Bm
I've been chasing my mind
               D
Lonely in the cold nights
[Chorus]

                       G
Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
                    Em7
Can't pick up the phone without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
                      G
And I'm digging down holes without you
               Em7
Can't be on my own without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
[Bridge]

 Em7
Hold me close when it's over
 Bm
Life goes slow loving sober
 Em7
Feel my bones getting older
 D
Sadness grows when you're cold
           Em7
Cause I am one step heavy and two steps high
 Bm
Hold it steady with you by my side
Em7
One step heavy and two steps high
  D
Two steps high
[Chorus]

                       G
Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
                    Em7
Can't pick up the phone without you
                  Bm              D
I'm a little bit lost without you
                      G
And I'm digging down holes without you
               Em7
Can't be on my own without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
[Outro]

G
Without you
Em7
Without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
                      G
And I'm digging down holes without you
               Em7
Can't be on my own without you
                  Bm
I'm a little bit lost without you
D
Without you
