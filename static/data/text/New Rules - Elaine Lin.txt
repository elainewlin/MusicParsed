[Verse 1]

A                 E
I’m done with the mind games
         F♯m
Am I too interested?
         D          A
Am I too desperate?
            E        F♯m   D
Don’t wanna care any less
[Pre-Chorus]

Dsus2             Esus4
Pretending I have things to do
     F♯m                A
When all I have is solitude?
Dsus2               Esus4
Pretending you have things to do
     F♯m                    A
When you’re just as lonely too
[Chorus]

   E               Dsus2     A
So can we make new rules for love?
               E         Dsus2
Let’s make new rules for love
E               Dsus2     A
Can we make new rules for love?
               E         Dsus2
Let’s make new rules for love
[Verse 2]

A                  E
Can’t place what’s wrong, dear
            F♯m
Are you too nervous?
              D        A
We’re both so nervous.
            E        F♯m   D
Don’t wanna care any less
[Pre-Chorus]

Dsus2               Esus4
Pretending you have things to do
     F♯m                  A
When all you have is solitude?
Dsus2             Esus4
Pretending I have things to do
     F♯m                 A
When I'm just as lonely too
[Chorus]

   E               Dsus2     A
So can we make new rules for love?
               E         Dsus2
Let’s make new rules for love
E               Dsus2     A
Can we make new rules for love?
               E         Dsus2
Let’s make new rules for love
[Bridge]
     D
I’ll say what’s on my mind
     E
I'll ask for what I want
  A
I won’t be afraid
So won’t you
D
say what’s on your mind
E
Ask for what you want?
      A
Dear, don’t be afraid

[Chorus]
E                    Dsus2     A
Can those be the new rules for love?
               E         Dsus2 
Let’s have new rules for love
E                    Dsus2     A
Can those be the new rules for love?
               E         Dsus2  A
Let’s have new rules for love
