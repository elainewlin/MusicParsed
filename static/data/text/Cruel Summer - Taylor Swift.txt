CAPO 2

[Intro]
G
  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
 
[Verse 1]
C                       D
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
    Bm                                     Em
You know that I caught it (oh yeah, you’re right, I want it)
C                   D
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
    Bm                                     Em
You know that I bought it (oh yeah, you’re right, I want it)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
            C                D
 Killing me slow, out the window
                   Bm                      Em
I’m always waiting for you to be waiting below
                C
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
             D
What doesn’t kill me makes me want you more
 
 
[Chorus]
         G
And it’s new, the shape of your body
     Bm
It’s blue, the feeling I’ve got
         Em
And it’s ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh
       C
It’s a cruel summer
 
     G
It’s cool, that’s what I tell ’em
   Bm
No rules in breakable heaven
    Em
But ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh
       C                  G
It’s a cruel summer, with you
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                         D                     Bm
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
                               Em
I’m not dying (oh yeah, you’re right, I want it)
   C                            D                  Bm
We say that we’ll just screw it up in these trying times
                                  Em
We’re not trying (oh yeah, you’re right, I want it)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
               C                  D
So cut the headlights, summer’s a knife
                   Bm                         Em
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
                C
Devils roll the dice (dice), angels roll their eyes (eyes)
         D
And if I bleed, you’ll be the last to know
 
 
[Chorus]
        G
Oh it’s new, the shape of your body
     Bm
It’s blue, the feeling I’ve got
         Em
And it’s ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh
       C
It’s a cruel summer
 
     G
It’s cool, that’s what I tell ’em
   Bm
No rules in breakable heaven
    Em
But ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh
       C                  G
It’s a cruel summer, with you
 
 
[Bridge]
I’m drunk in the back of the car
      Bm
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Em
 Said "I’m fine", but it wasn’t true
        C
I don’t wanna keep secrets just to keep you
 
    G
And I snuck in through the garden gate
      Bm
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
Em
 And I scream "For whatever it’s worth
  C                                             
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?"
 
He looks up, grinning like a devil
 
 
[Chorus]
     G
It’s new, the shape of your body
     Bm
It’s blue, the feeling I’ve got
         Em
And it’s ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh
       C
It’s a cruel summer
 
     G
It’s cool, that’s what I tell ’em
   Bm
No rules in breakable heaven
    Em
But ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh
       C                  G
It’s a cruel summer, with you
 
 
[Outro]
  I’m drunk in the back of the car
      Bm
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Em
 Said "I’m fine", but it wasn’t true
        C
I don’t wanna keep secrets just to keep you
 
    G
And I snuck in through the garden gate
      Bm
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
Em
 And I scream "For whatever it’s worth
  C                                             G
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?"
 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
