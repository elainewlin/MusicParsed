[Verse]
I woke up numb
Just three years ago
Thoughts my time had come
My doctor said it wasn't so
so he gave me pills
to change the chemicals in my brain.
They made me feel alive.
They made me feel sane.

[Chorus]
I'm gonna change
(the chemicals in my brain) 
I'm gonna change
I'm gonna change
(the chemicals in my brain) 
I'm gonna change

[Break]
ba da ba ba ba ba da ba da

[Verse]
I would try to eat 
so I could feel complete 
so I could feel anything 
but that's no easy feat 
I would try to kiss 
so I could feel bliss 
and everybody had a good time 
but my abyss is bottomless 

[Chorus]
I'm gonna change
(the chemicals in my brain) 
I'm gonna change
I'm gonna change
(the chemicals in my brain) 
I'm gonna change
I'm gonna change
(the chemicals in my brain) 
I'm gonna rearrange
(the chemicals in my brain) 
I'm gonna change

[Bridge]
G5 Em7 G5 F♯
I wanna feel something real 
I'm gonna stick a needle in my vein 
I'm gonna feel the pain 
slip away
