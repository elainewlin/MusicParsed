
G            Am              Em      C
I close both locks below the window.
G            Am              Em    C
I close both blinds and turn away.
G         Am                  Em      C
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple.
G         Am                 Em   C  
Sometimes goodbye's the only way. 

G           Am           Em   C
And the sun will set for you, 
G       Am           Em   C
the sun will set for you.
G                 Am  
The shadow of the day,
     Em                   C
will embrace the world in grey, 
G           Am          Em   C
and the sun will set for you.

G              Am              Em      C
Pink cards and flowers on your window, 
G                Am               Em    C
your frineds all plead for you to stay.
G         Am                 Em      C
Sometimes beginngs aren't so simple.
G         Am                 Em   C   
Sometimes goodbye's the only way.

G           Am           Em   C
And the sun will set for you, 
G       Am           Em    C
the sun will set for you.
G                 Am
The shadow of the day,
     Em                   C
will embrace the world in grey, 
G           Am          Em   C
and the sun will set for you.
