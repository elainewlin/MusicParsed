[Verse]

Em                                              D
They told him, Don't you ever come around here.
           Em
Don't wanna see your face,
                   D
You better disappear
        C                                        D
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
     Em
So beat it
       Em
Just beat it
Em
You better run
                  D
You better do what you can
           Em
Don't wanna see no blood
                  D
Don't be a macho man
        C
You wanna be tough
           D
Better do what you can
     Em
So beat it
              D
But you wanna be bad


[Chorus]

Em
Just beat (beat it)
D
Beat it (Beat it)
Em                                  D
No one wants to be defeated
          Em                                 D
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
   Em                              D
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
        Em
Just beat it
        D
Just beat it
        Em
Just beat it
        D
Just beat it


[Verse]

Em
They're out to get you
           D
Better leave while you can
           Em
Don't wanna be a boy
                   D
You wanna be a man
        C
You wanna stay alive
           D
Better do what you can
      Em
So beat it
        D
Just beat it
Em                                                    D
You have to show them that you're really not scared
            Em
You're playin' with your life
                      D
This ain't no truth or dare
             C                                                                D
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you its fair
      Em
So beat it
             D
But you wanna be bad


[Chorus]

Em
Just beat (beat it)
D
Beat it (Beat it)
Em                                  D
No one wants to be defeated
          Em                                 D
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
   Em                              D
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
        Em
Just beat it
        D
Just beat it
        Em
Just beat it
        D
Just beat it
