G              C                 G
Me and my baby on a february holiday
                  D
'cause we got the news
         C       G
Yeah, we got the news
G                   C                     G
500 miles and we're gonna make it all the way
                     D
We've got nothing to lose
          C          G
We've got nothing to lose


Pre-Chorus:
          C
It's been 10 years waiting
         C
But it's better late than the never
G          D      Em
We've been told before
         C               D
We can't wait one minute more


Chorus:
G             C            G
Oh, me and my baby driving down
     C             G               D     D6  D7
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
G             C             G
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
             D               Em
You've never seen a sight so fine
       C                 D
As the love that's gonna shine
        G
At city hall


Verse 2:
G                      C                         G
Me and my baby've been through a lot of good and bad
                    D
Learned to kiss the sky
         C       G
Made our momma's cry
     G                           C         D   Em
I've seen a lot of friends after giving it all they had
             C     D
Lay down and die
             G
Lay down and die


Pre-Chorus:
C                C
10 years into it here's our window
       G     D          Em
At the vegas drive-thru chapel
             C                   D
It ain't too much for 'em all to handle


Chorus:
G             C            G
Oh, me and my baby driving down
     C             G               D     D6  D7
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
G             C             G
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
             D               Em
You've never seen a sight so fine
       C                 D
As the love that's gonna shine
        G
At city hall


Verse 3:
   G                         C                G
Outside, they're handing out donuts and pizza pies
                 D
For the folks in pairs
       C       G
in the folding chairs
   G                        C                         G
My baby's lookin' so damned pretty with those anxious eyes
              D
Rain-speckled hair
               C    G Am G
And my ring to wear


Pre-Chorus:
C                         C
10 years waiting for this moment of fate
        G       D                  Em
When we say the words and sign our names
        G       D    Em        D
If they take it away again someday
     C          G          D
This beautiful thing won't change


Chorus:
G             C            G
Oh, me and my baby driving down
     C             G               D     D6  D7
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
G             C             G
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
             D               Em
You've never seen a sight so fine
       C                 D
As the love that's gonna shine
        G
At city hall
