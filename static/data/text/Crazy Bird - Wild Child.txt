[Verse]
Am
I'll wait around for days
F                          C
This porch on which I pace
                               G
I need you mine I need me yours

Am                      F
You stole my breath away

You swore to me youd stay
C                             G
I found something that I adore

[Chorus]
F                            C
Oh how, how it's supposed to go on
             F
Not knowing if you
               C
Bleed the way, I do
G                 F
I do, well I did
                          C
Are your bags travellin elsewhere
Dm
You need to know I got the bones
                            G
Rollin hard against the floor oooo
Dm
And if you left I'd break until the
                   G              Em
little pieces fell no more, no more


[Verse 2]
Am                           F
Whisper the things we'd scream

Now kids let's not get mean
C                                   G
Cause I need your mind I need me yours

Em

Am                       F
For walls of fancy friends

Don't need me none of them
C                              G
Cause I've got you know and thats enough

Well I'm glad, so am I

Am                      F
Let's make it from our cast

I chose the things that last
C                               G
Let's tear it up here you and I

[Chorus]
F                            C
Oh how, how it's supposed to go on
             F
Not knowing if you
               C
Bleed the way, I do
G               F
I do, well I did
                          C
Are your bags travelling elsewhere
Dm
You need to know I got the bones
                            G
Rolling hard against the floor oooo
Dm
And if you left I'd break until the
                   G         Em
little pieces fell no more, no more

[Verse 3]
F                             G
These fights sure do take a lot outta me
F                                        G
But it's a secret I can tell you is I still do believe
F                                    G
I can promise now I'll always be careful with things

F
So just know that I'll expect it
G
If you ever do leave
F
Sweet Marie
G
I love your name
F
Oh babe
G
Can you turn your heart this way



[Chorus]
F                            C
Oh how, how it's supposed to go on
             F
Not knowing if you
               C
Bleed the way, I do
G             F
I do, well I did
                          C
Are your bags travelling elsewhere
Dm
You need to know I got the bones
                            G
Rolling hard against the floor oooo
Dm
And if you left I'd break until the
                   G         Em
little pieces fell no more, no more
