CAPO 1
[Verse 1]

Am              G                C    F
  I thought that I've been hurt before
    Am            G                  C    F
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Am               G              C    F
  Your words cut deeper than a knife
      Am              G                  C     F
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life


[Pre-Chorus]

F                        G           Am
  Got a feeling that I'm going under
                     Am
But I know that I'll make it out alive
F                   G             Am
  If I quit calling you my lover
          G 
And move on


[Chorus]

             Am                        G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
             C                   F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches
Am                  G
Tripping over myself, Aching,
C                      F
Begging you to come help
             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches


[Verse 2]

Am           G               C    F
 Just like a moth drawn to a flame
        Am            G                  C    G
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Am            G                 C     F
  Your bitter heart cold to the touch
              Am              G              
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
                C         F
I'm left seeing red on my own


[Pre-Chorus]

F                        G           Am
  Got a feeling that I'm going under
                     Am
But I know that I'll make it out alive
F                   G             Am
  If I quit calling you my lover
          G 
And move on


[Chorus]
 
             Am                        G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
             C                   F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches
Am                  G
Tripping over myself, Aching,
C                      F
Begging you to come help
             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches

[Chorus]

             Am                        G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
             C                   F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches
Am                  G
Tripping over myself, Aching,
C                      F
Begging you to come help

And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches


[Outro]

             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses

             Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches
