[Verse]
Dm         Bb               F
When I was wandering in the desert
        C
And was searching for the truth
Dm        Bb              F              C
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
Dm        Bb              F                C
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
Bb                           C
I turned my face towards the barren sun

[Pre-Chorus]
      D           F             Bb       C
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me
      G5           Bb         F              C
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
        D             F              Bb              C
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground
         G5             Bb          C
They are sealed and are now washed away

[Chorus]
Dm          Dsus4
You tell me we can start the rain
Dm          Dsus4
You tell me that we all can change
Bb          Dsus4       F            C
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
Dm          Dsus4
You tell me we can start the rain
Dm          Dsus4
You tell me that we all can change
Bb          Dsus4       F            C
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears
