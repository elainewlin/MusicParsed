[Verse 1]
C                              F
If there’ s a prize for rotten judgement
G                    F
I guess I’ve already won that
Am                  Dm
No man is worth the aggravation
G
That’s ancient history, been there, done that
C
Who’d ya think ya kidding?
F
He’s the earth and heaven to ya
C                                 F
Try to keep it hidden, honey we can see right through ya
F
Girl ya can’t conceal it
Em                 Dm                         G
We know how your feelin’ who you’re thinking of
C                  Am
No chance, no way, I won’t say it, no no
                                 F
You swoon, you sigh why deny it, uh oh
G
It’s too…cliché

[Verse 2]
C
I won’t say I’m in love
C                                  F
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
Em                      
It feels so good when ya start out
Am                               Dm
My head is screaming "get a grip, girl!"
G
"Unless your dying to cry your heart out!""
C
You keep on denying
F
Who you are and how your feelin’
C                               F
Baby, we're not lying, hone we saw ya hit the ceiling 
F
Face it like a grown up
Em                          Dm                   G
When ya gonna own up that ya got, got, got it bad
C                   Am
No chance, no way, I won’t say it, no no

[Chorus]
Give up, give in
F                   G

           F
You’re way off base I won’t say it
                        G

                                 Am
I won’t say I’m in love 
G       D

D                                                  Bm
No chance, no way, I won’t say it, no no
 
[Chorus 2]
Give up, give in
                                    G
Check the grin, your in love!
                         A

D                                                  Bm
No chance, no way, I won’t say it, no no

Give up, give in
                                       G
Check the grin, you’re in love!
                          A
The scene won’t play
                            D
I won’t say I’m in love
Bm               G
