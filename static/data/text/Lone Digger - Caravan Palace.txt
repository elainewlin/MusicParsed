[Intro x4]

Em   Am   C   B
[Verse]

Em            Am
Hey, brother, what you thinking?
C              B
Leave that old record spinning
Em           Am
You feel the rhythm, going
C              B
(They call it lonely digging)
Em             Am
Let's end your time to lay low
C              B
Your knees a-bending, so
Em           Am
It's time to get up and let go
C              B
(You're gonna come undone)
Em         Am
Hey, mama, how's it going?
C              B
Can't see your body moving
Em               Am
Don't leave the party dying
C              B
(They call it lonely digging)
Em           Am
Your booty shaking, you know
C                 B
Your head has no right to say no
Em             Am                 C          B
Tonight it's "ready, set, go"
[Chorus]

             Em
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
       Am
So we can get with 'em,
       C                   B
To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
    Em                    Am
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
C                  B
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
             Em
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
           Am                      C
Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
   B                   Em                           Am               C       B
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
[Verse]

Em            Am
Hey, brother, what you thinking?
C              B
That good ol' sound is ringing
Em               Am
They don't know what they're missing
C              B
(They call it lonely digging)
Em             Am
Let's end your time to lay low
C              B
Your knees a-bending, so
Em           Am                 C          B
It's time to get up and let go
Em            Am
Hey, brother, nice and steady
C               B
Put down your drink, you ready
Em              Am
It's hard when things get messy
C              B
(They call it lonely digging)
Em           Am
Your booty shaking, you know
C                 B
Your head has no right to say no
Em             Am                 C          B
Tonight it's "ready, set, go"
[Chorus]

             Em

       Am
So we can get with 'em,
       C                   B

           Am                      C
Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
   B                   Em                           Am               C       B
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
