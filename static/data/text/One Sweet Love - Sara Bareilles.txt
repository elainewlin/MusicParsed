[Verse]

D               Em7
Just about the time the shadows call
G                       D
I undress my mind and dare you to follow
                   Em7
Paint a portrait of my mystery
G                       D
Only close my eyes and you are here with me
  Em7
A nameless face to think I see
  G                               D
To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone
  Em7                             G
A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is made out of
               C           G    
My own devices.. Could I be wrong?


[CHORUS]

    D             Em7        G
The time that I've taken
  D           Em7       G
I pray is not wasted
        D      Em7   G             D   Em7      G
Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?


[Verse]

D                       Em7
Sleepless nights you creep inside of me
G                           D
Paint your shadows on the breath that we share
                          Em7
You take more than just my sanity
G                     D
You take my reason not to care.
   Em7
No ordinary wings I'll need
     G                       D
The sky itself will carry me back to you
     Em7                              G
The things I dream that I can do I'll open up
                   C
The moon for you
                G
Just come down soon


[CHORUS]

    D             Em7        G
The time that I've taken
  D           Em7       G
I pray is not wasted
        D      Em7   G             D   Em7      G
Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
  D       Em7    G      D              Em7      G       
Ready and waiting for a heart worth the breaking
                      D         Em7    G
But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of
D    Em7   G
One sweet love.


[Verse]

A                    G
Savor the sorrow to soften the pain sip on
    Bm
The southern rain
     A                                     G
As I do, I don't look don't touch don't do anything
                    Em F#m  G
But hope that there is a you.

     Em7
The earth that is the space between,
    G                       D
I'd banish it from under me...to get to you.
    Em7                         G
Your unexpected love provides my solitary's suicide...
C             G
oh I wish I knew


[CHORUS]

    D             Em7        G
The time that I've taken
  D           Em7       G
I pray is not wasted
        D      Em7   G             D   Em7      G
Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
  D       Em7    G      D              Em7      G       
Ready and waiting for a heart worth the breaking
                      D         Em7    G
But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of
D    Em7   G
One sweet love.


[Outro]

D    Em7   G
One sweet love.
