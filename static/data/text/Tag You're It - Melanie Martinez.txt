CAPO 1

[Verse 1]

Em            C               A
Looking at me through your window
         Em               C       A
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
      Em              C         A
"I'll cut you up and make you dinner
        Em                  C        B7
You've reached the end, you are the winner"
Em                 C        A
Rolling down your tinted window
Em              C         A
Driving next to me real slow, he said
Em                C       A
"Let me take you for a joyride
Em                  C         B7
I've got some candy for you inside"
[Chorus]

Em                  C
Running through the parking lot
    D            A
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Em               C
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
D                    A
Took the words right out my mouth
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
    Em      C            D             A
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
    Em      C             D            A
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
        Em           C   D                A
Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
              Em          C   D                A
He's saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
[Verse 2]

Em            C         A
Little bit of poison in me
Em               C           A
I can taste your skin in my teeth
   Em             C            A
"I love it when I hear you breathing
  Em                 C        B7
I hope to God you're never leaving"
[Chorus]

Em                  C
Running through the parking lot
    D            A
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Em               C
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
D                    A
Took the words right out my mouth
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
    Em      C            D             A
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
    Em      C             D            A
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
        Em           C   D                A
Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
              Em          C   D                A
He's saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
[Bridge]

Em           C
Eenie meenie miny mo
A
Catch your lady by her toes
Em                    C           A
If she screams, don't let her go
Em           C
Eenie meenie miny mo
     A                            Em       C
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
      B7
And I am
[Chorus]

Em                  C
Running through the parking lot
    D            A
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Em               C
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
D                    A
Took the words right out my mouth
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Em                  C
Running through the parking lot
    D            A
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Em               C
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
D                    A
Took the words right out my mouth
Em          C   D                A
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
