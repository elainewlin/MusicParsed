[Verse 1]
Fm            C#               A#
Looking at me through your window
         Fm               C#       A#
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
      Fm              C#         A#
"I'll cut you up and make you dinner
        Fm                  C#        C7
You've reached the end, you are the winner"

Fm                 C#        A#
Rolling down your tinted window
Fm              C#         A#
Driving next to me real slow, he said
Fm                C#       A#
"Let me take you for a joyride
Fm                  C#         C7
I've got some candy for you inside"


[Chorus]
Fm                  C#
Running through the parking lot
    D#            A#
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Fm          C#   D#                A#
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Fm               C#
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
D#                    A#
Took the words right out my mouth
Fm          C#   D#                A#
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
    Fm      C#            D#             A#
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
    Fm      C#             D#            A#
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
        Fm           C#   D#                A#
Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
              Fm          C#   D#                A#
He's saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"


[Verse 2]
Fm            C#         A#
Little bit of poison in me
Fm               C#           A#
I can taste your skin in my teeth
   Fm             C#            A#
"I love it when I hear you breathing
  Fm                 C#        C7
I hope to God you're never leaving"

Took the words right out my mouth
Fm          C#   D#                A#
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
