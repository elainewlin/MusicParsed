Satisfied from Hamilton (written by Lin-Manuel Miranda)


[LAURENS]

Cm7                               Eb/Bb
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
           Cm7/F
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Ab9               G7
Angelica Schuyler!


[ANGELICA/COMPANY]

               Cm7
A toast to the groom (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
       Eb/Bb
To the bride (To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
          Cm7/F
From your sister (Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
        Ab9                          G7
Who is always by your side (By your side)
        Cm7
To your union (To the union! To the revolution!)
        Eb/Bb
And the hope that you provide (provide, provide)
        Cm7/F
May you always (always)
    Ab9        G7
Be satisfied (rewind)


[REWIND INTERLUDE]


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
I remember that night I just might
Cm7
regret that night for the rest of my days
Eb/Bb
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves
Eb/Bb
to win our praise
Cm7/F
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Cm7/F
like a dream that you can't quite place
Ab9                  G7                                   Cm7
But Alexander I'll never forget the first time I saw your face
Cm7
I have never been the same
Eb/Bb
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
    Cm7/F
And when you said "hi" I forgot my dang name
       Ab9                      G7
Set my heart aflame, every part aflame
G7
This is not a game


[HAMILTON]

Cm7
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied


[ANGELICA]

Eb/Bb
I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself


[HAMILTON]

Cm7/F
You're like me. I'm never satisfied


[ANGELICA]

Ab9
Is that right?


[HAMILTON]

G7
I have never been satisfied


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
My name is Angelica Schuyler


[HAMILTON]

Eb/Bb
Alexander Hamilton


[ANGELICA]
Cm7
Where's your family from?


[HAMILTON]

Cm7/F
Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done
Ab7            G7
Just you wait, just you wait


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
So so so, so this is what it feels like to match wits
Cm7
with someone at your level. What the hell is the catch?
         Eb/Bb
It's the feeling of freedom, of seeing the light
Eb/Bb
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
Eb/Bb
You see it right?
Cm7/F
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Cm7/F
Everything we said in total agreement
Ab9
It's a dream and it's a bit of a dance
G7
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
       Cm7
He's a bit of a flirt but I'mma give it a chance
Cm7
I asked about his family, did you see his answer?
    Eb/Bb
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
Eb/Bb
He's penniless; he's flying by the seat of his pants
Cm7/F
Handsome, boy does he know it
Cm7/F
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it
Ab9
I wanna take him far away from this place
       G7
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...


[ELIZA]

Cm7
Helpless


[ANGELICA]
Cm7
And I know she is


[ELIZA]

Cm7/Bb
Helpless


[ANGELICA]
Cm7
And her eyes are just


[ELIZA]

Cm7/F
Helpless


[ANGELICA]

                    Ab9                                  G7
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time


[HAMILTON]

Cm7
Where are you taking me?


[ANGELICA]
Cm7
I'm about to change your life.


[HAMIlTON]
Cm7
Then by all means, lead the way.


[COMPANY]

       Cm7
Number one!


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
Eb/Bb
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Eb/Bb
who has to social climb for one
            Cm7/F
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
Cm7/F
New York City is insidious
Ab9
And Alexander is penniless
G7
That doesn't mean I want him any less


[ELIZA]

Cm7
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you.


[HAMILTON]
Cm7
Schuyler?


[ANGELICA]
Cm7
My sister.


[COMPANY]

       Cm7
Number two!


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister

That elevates his status
    Eb/Bb
I'd have to be naive to set that aside

Maybe that is why
Cm7/F
I introduce him to Eliza

Now that's his bride
Ab9
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
G7
You will never be satisfied


[ELIZA]

Cm7
Thank you for all your service.


[HAMILTON]
Cm7
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it.


[ANGELICA]

I'll leave you to it.


[COMPANY]

       Cm7
Number three!


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
I know my sister like I know my own mind
          Eb/Bb
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
     Cm7/F
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
        Ab9
He'd be mine
                   G7
She would say "I'm fine"
G7
She'd be lying
Cm7
But when I fantasize at night it's Alexander's eyes
Eb/Bb
as I romanticize what might have been if I hadn't
Cm7/F
sized him up so quickly
                             Eb
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
                                    G7
At least I keep his eyes in my life


[ANGELICA/COMPANY]

        Cm7
To the groom! (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
       Eb/Bb
To the bride! (To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
          Cm7/F
From your sister (Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
        Ab9                          G7
Who is always by your side (By your side)
        Cm7
To your union (To the union! To the revolution!)
        Eb7
And the hope that you provide (provide, provide)
        Cm7/F
May you always (always)
    Ab9                      G7
Be satisfied (satisfied, satisfied, satisfied)
      Cm7
And I know
           Eb/Bb
she'll be happy as his bride
      Cm7/F

Ab9
He will never be satisfied
G7                               Cm7
I will never be satisfied
