[Verse 1]
Bm                        A
Sitting in the backseat, dead heat summer
Em                          G
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
Bm                     A
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Em                          G
Running round my head in a holy fire
Bm                 A
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Em                 G
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Bm                          A              Em
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
                 G
Don't run, don't hide

[Pre-Chorus]
    Bm             D             Em               G
And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
             Bm              D
We're making waves of conversation
      Em           G
Got a rush of energy

[Chorus]
       Bm          A              Em
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans
Bm          A              Em
I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans

[Instrumental x2]
Bm A Em G 

[Verse 2]
Bm                      A
Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Em                            G
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
Bm                       A
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Em                           G
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Bm                     A
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Em                            G
Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?
Bm                          A              Em
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
                 G
Don't run, don't hide

[Pre-Chorus]
    Bm             D             Em               G
And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
             Bm              D
We're making waves of conversation
      Em           G
Got a rush of energy

[Chorus]
       Bm          A              Em
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans
Bm          A              Em
I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans
Bm           A               Em               G
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
    Bm          A              Em
And I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans

[Instrumental x2]

[Bridge]
Bm          D
We ride up, we slide up
A              G
We won't stop, we won't stop
Bm          D
We ride up, we slide up
A              G
We won't stop, no, we won't stop
Bm          D
We ride up, we slide up
A             G
We won't stop lighting our minds up
Bm          D
We ride up, we slide up
A             G
We won't stop lighting our minds up

[Chorus]
       Bm          A              Em
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans
Bm          A              Em
I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans
Bm           A               Em               G
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
    Bm          A              Em
And I'm getting high, getting high
            G
I'm getting high on humans
