Far Away
C#m                    G#m
This ship is taking me far away
E
Far away from the
B
Memories
C#m                   G#m               E
Of all the people who care if I live or die

Starlight
C#m                   G#m
I will be chasing the starlight
E
Until the end of my

Let's conspire to ig-nite
C#m                      G#m            E
All the souls that would die just to be alive
