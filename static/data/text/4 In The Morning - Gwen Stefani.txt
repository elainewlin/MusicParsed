Am                  C
Wakin up to find another day

The moon got lost again last night
Am                            C
But now the sun has finally had its say
F                       C
I guess I feel alright
       F                                      Am
But it hurts when I think, when I let it sink in
              G
It’s all over me
              F
I know you’re here, in the dark
                  C                   G
I’m watchin' you sleep, it hurts a lot

    Ab    Bb             Gm             Cm

And I wanna make it worth the fight
                      Gm

  Don’t wanna lose the love I found
Am                            C
  Remember when you said that you would change
