CAPO 1

Am7 G6 Dadd4/A C6/G

[Verse]

Am            Gadd2
Lay down your slow
     D                         Cadd2
Come settle down, settle down
Am             Gadd2
Let loose your glow
     D                         Cadd2
Come settle down, settle down
    Am                  C
And I feel life for the very first time,
Em                       D
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
Am                 C
I feel safe in the 5am light
    Em                    D
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                     Em
Spinning on our feet
     D            Am
In a Technicolour beat
            C
You and me
G                      Em
Caught up in a dream
     D            C           Em7   Em7sus4
In a Technicolour beat, beat, beat, beat

[Verse]

Am        Gadd2
Warm, unalone
     D                         Cadd2
Come settle down, settle down
Am            Gadd2
Swing me your bones
     D                         Cadd2
Come settle down, settle down
    Am                  C
And I feel life for the very first time,
Em                       D
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
Am                 C
I feel safe in the 5am light
    Em                    D
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                     Em
Spinning on our feet
     D                  Am
In a Technicolour beat
            C
You and me
G                     Em
Caught up in a dream
     D            C
In a Technicolour beat, beat

[Bridge]

Am               G
Give me one drop, I can feel you
D               C
Make me lose control
Am              G
We’ll be walking on the water,
D
We’re moving in a Technicolour beat,
Moving in a Technicolour

[Chorus]

Am
Jump into the heat
   C
(Falling off the ceiling)
G
Spinning on our feet
        Em          D            Am
(We're moving) in a Technicolour beat
You and me
      C
(Found another feeling)
G
Caught up in a dream,
        Em         D
(We're moving in a Technicolour beat)

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G
Spinning on our feet
        Em          D            Am
(We're moving) in a Technicolour beat
             C
You and me,
G
Caught up in a dream,
        Em          D
(We're moving) in a Technicolour beat, beat, beat
