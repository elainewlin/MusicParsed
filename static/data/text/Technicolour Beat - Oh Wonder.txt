[Verse]

Am              Em
Lay down your sword
     D                         C
Come settle down, settle down
Am              Em
Let loose your glow
     D                         C
Come settle down, settle down
   Am                   C
And I feel life for the very first time,
Em                        D
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
Am                 C
I feel safe in the 5am light
 Em                        D                    C
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                       Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am
In a Technicolour beat
            C
You & me...
G                      Em
Caught up in a dream
D                 C          Em
In a Technicolour beat, beat, beat, beat
C           Em
Beat, beat, beat, beat


[Verse]

Am         Em
Warm and alone
      D                        C
Come settle down, settle down
Am               Em
Swing me your bones
      D                        C
Come settle down, settle down
   Am                   C
And I feel life for the very first time,
Em                        D
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
Am                 C
I feel safe in the 5am light
 Em                        D               C
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                       Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am
In a Technicolour beat
            C
You & me...
G                      Em
Caught up in a dream
D                 C           Em
In a Technicolour beat, beat, beat, beat
C           Em
Beat, beat, beat, beat
[Bridge]

Am                  Em
Give me one drop, I can feel you
D                   C
Make me lose control
Am               Em
We be walking on the water,
D                                 C
We’re moving in a Technicolour beat,
C
Moving in a Technicolour beat.
[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat (Falling off the ceiling)
G                     Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am
In a Technicolour beat
           C
You & me, (Found another feeling)
G                     Em
Caught up in a dream,
D                  C
In a Technicolour beat
