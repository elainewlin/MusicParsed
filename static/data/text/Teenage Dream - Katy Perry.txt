[Verse]

Ebmaj7                      F
 You think I'm pretty, without any make-up on
Ebmaj7                      F
 You think I'm funny, when I tell the punch line wrong
Ebmaj7                  F
 I know you get me, so I'll let my walls come
 Ebmaj7  F
 Down, down

Ebmaj7          Gm  F
 Before you met I  was a wreck, but
Ebmaj7                     Gm  F
 Things were kinda heavy, you  brought me to life, now
 Ebmaj7           Gm    F
 Every February, you'll be my 
    Ebmaj7       Gm   F
 Valentine, valentine


[Bridge]

          Ebmaj7    Gm  F
 Let's go all, the way tonight
      Ebmaj7       Gm   F
 No regrets, just love
        Ebmaj7    Gm    F
 We can dance, until we die
        Ebmaj7        Gm   F
 You and I, we'll be young forever


[Chorus]

 Ebmaj7      Gm F
 You make me    feel like I'm living a 
 Ebmaj7      Gm  F
 Teenage Dream,  the way you turn me on
 Ebmaj7       Gm F
 I can't sleep     Let's runaway
Ebmaj7          Gm      F
 And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

 Ebmaj7       Gm  F
 My heart stops,    when you look at me
 Ebmaj7       Gm  F
 Just one touch,    now baby I believe
 Ebmaj7       Gm  F
 This is real,      so take a chance
           Ebmaj7                 Gm  F
 And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

 
[Verse]

Ebmaj7              Gm     F
 We drove to Cali, and got drunk on the beach
Ebmaj7             Gm     F
 Got a motel and, built a floor out of sheets
Ebmaj7                Gm         F
 I finally found you, my missing puzzle
 Ebmaj7      Gm      F
 Piece, I'm complete


[Bridge]

          Ebmaj7    Gm  F
 Let's go all, the way tonight
      Ebmaj7       Gm   F
 No regrets, just love
        Ebmaj7    Gm    F
 We can dance, until we die
        Ebmaj7        Gm   F
 You and I, we'll be young forever


[Chorus]

 Ebmaj7      Gm F
 You make me    feel like I'm living a 
 Ebmaj7      Gm  F
 Teenage Dream,  the way you turn me on
 Ebmaj7       Gm F
 I can't sleep     Let's runaway
Ebmaj7          Gm      F
 And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

 Ebmaj7       Gm  F
 My heart stops,    when you look at me
 Ebmaj7       Gm  F
 Just one touch,    now baby I believe
 Ebmaj7       Gm  F
 This is real,      so take a chance
           Ebmaj7                 Gm  F
 And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

 
[Verse]

                 Ebmaj7            Gm     F
I might get your heart racing, in my skin-tight jeans
        Ebmaj7           Gm  F
Be your teenage dream tonight
                 Ebmaj7           Gm     F
Let you put your hands on me, in my skin-tight jeans
        Ebmaj7           Gm  F
Be your teenage dream tonight

 Just one touch,    now baby I believe
