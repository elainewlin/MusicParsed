[Intro] 
C   G   Am  F   C   G   Am   F


[Verse]    
C      G                Am          F
Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
C            G                    Am       F
She took the midnight train going anywhere
C       G        Am                 F
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
C           G                    Am  F
He took the midnight train going anywhere

[Instrumental]
C   G   Am  F   C   G   Am   

[Verse] [island strum]   
C             G         Am
A singer in a smoky room,
                      F
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
C                    G                        
For a smile they can share the night, 
Em                 F
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
F                 C
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
      F                        C
Their shadows searching in the night
F                    C
Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
F                        G    C    G  C  F
Hiding, somewhere in the night

[Instrumental]
C   G   Am   F

[Verse]
C               G           Am         F
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
C                  G                   Am       F
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
C              G               Am                F
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
C             G                
Oh, the movie never ends; 
Em                 F
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
F                 C
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
      F                        C
Their shadows searching in the night
F                    C
Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
F                        G    C    G  C  F
Hiding, somewhere in the night

[Instrumental]
C   G   Am   F   C   G   Em   F

[Chorus]
C          G          Am              F
Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
C           G      Em           F
Streetlight people oo-oh
C          G          Am              F
Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
C           G           Em           F
Streetlight people oo-oh

C
Don't stop
