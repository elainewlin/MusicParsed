[Verse]
Bm
On a cold winters morning
       G
In the time before the light
   A
In flames of death's eternal rain
   A               Bm
We ride towards the fight

Bm
When the darkness is falling down
        G
And the times are tough alright
    A
The sound of evil laughter
       Bm
Falls around the world tonight

Bm
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
            G
Through the wastelands evermore
    A
The scattered souls will feel the hell
       Bm
Bodies wasted on the shores

[Pre-Chorus]
       Em
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
   Bm
We watch them as they go
   G                               A
In fire and pain, now once again we know
          D       A
So now we fly ever free,
      G
We're free before the thunderstorm
Bm             A
on towards the wilderness
    G
Our quest carries on
Bm             G       Bm             D
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
G                                 A
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

[Chorus]
        G                  Bm
So far away we wait for the day
        A                         F#m
For the light source so wasted and gone
            G                      Bm
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
            A                   Bm
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

[Verse]
Bm
As the red day is dawning
        G
And the lightning cracks the sky
          A
They will raise their hands to the heavens above
       Bm
With resentment in their eyes

Bm
Running back through the midmorning light
          G
There's a burning in my heart
      A
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
     Bm
To a life beyond the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
        Em
In your darkest dreams you still believe
    Bm
Our destiny this time
    G                            A
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

           D         A        G
And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality
Bm           A           G
All alone in desperation, now that time has come
Bm                 G          Bm             D
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
G                                A
Day after day this misery must go on

[Chorus]
       G                   Bm
So far away we wait for the day
        A                         F#m
For the light source so wasted and gone
            G                      Bm
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
            A                       Bm
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

[Bridge]
            Bm                            G
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
             A                   D
We fought so hard now can we understand
               Bm                      G
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
    A               F#
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]
       G                   Bm
So far away we wait for the day
        A                         F#m
For the light source so wasted and gone
            G                      Bm
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
            A                       Bm
Through the fire and the flames we carry on
