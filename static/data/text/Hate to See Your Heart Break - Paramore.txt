[Verse 1]

F                     Dm
There is not a single word
             F
In the whole world 
                        Dm
That could describe the hurt
                       A#
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
                    C
Ripping through the softest skin there ever was 


[Pre-Chorus]

                A#
How were you to know? 
                C
How were you to know? 


[Chorus]

    F                     Dm
And I, I hate to see your heart break
                   A#
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
    C
But I've been there before
    F                     Dm
And I, I hate to see your heart break
                   A#
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
    C
But I've been there before


[Verse 2]

F                    Dm
Love happens all the time
                     F
To people who aren't kind
                   Dm
And heroes who are blind
                  A#
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
                     C
Who wants an awkward silence mystery?


[Pre-Chorus]

                A#
How were you to know? 
                C
How were you to know?


[Chorus]

    F                     Dm
And I, I hate to see your heart break
                   A#
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
    C
But I've been there before
    F                     Dm
And I, I hate to see your heart break
                   A#
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
    C                                A#
But I've been there before


[Bridge]

            Dm                 C                 A#
For all the air that's in your lungs
            Dm             C
For all the joy that is to come 
                        A#
For all the things that you're alive to feel
                    C
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal


[Pre-Chorus]

                A#
How were you to know? 
                C
How were you to know?


[Chorus]

    F                     Dm
And I, I hate to see your heart break
                   A#
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
    C
But I've been there before
    F                     Dm
And I, I hate to see your heart break
                   A#
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
    C
But I've been there before
