[Verse 1]

C                        G
Headed down south to the land of the pines
        Am                   F
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
C
Starin' up the road
            G         F
And pray to God I see headlights

  C                         G
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Am                      F
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
          C
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
      G             F
I can see my baby tonight


[Chorus]

   C                   G
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Am              F
Rock me mama anyway you feel
C   G     F
Hey, mama rock me
C                     G
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Am                  F
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
C   G     F
Hey, mama rock me


[Instrumental]

C  G  Am  F

[Verse 2]

C                     G
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
      Am                         F
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband
   C
My baby plays the guitar
G              F
I pick a banjo now

        C                            G
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
        Am                       F
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
      C
But I ain't a turnin' back
   G                    F
To livin' that old life no more


[Chorus]

   C                   G
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Am              F
Rock me mama anyway you feel
C   G     F
Hey, mama rock me
C                     G
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Am                  F
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
C   G     F
Hey, mama rock me


[Instrumental]

C  G  Am  F

[Verse 3]

C                    G
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
           Am
I caught a trucker out of Philly
      F
Had a nice long toke
    C                           G
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
   F
To Johnson City, Tennessee

      C                   G
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
          Am
I hear my baby callin' my name
      F
And I know that she's the only one
    C
And if I die in Raleigh
   G                F
At least I will die free


[Chorus]

   C                   G
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Am              F
Rock me mama anyway you feel
C   G     F
Hey, mama rock me
C                     G
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Am                  F
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
C   G     F           C
Hey, mama rock me
