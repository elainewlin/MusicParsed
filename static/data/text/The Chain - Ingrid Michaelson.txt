[Intro]
F      F/Eb       Dm        Db6

F  F/E  Dm  Dm/C  Bb  Bb/C  Dm

Dm      F/E


[Verse]
F             F/Eb
The sky looks pissed
Dm             Db6  
The wind talks back
F            F/E      Dm    Dm/C
My bones are shifting in my skin
Bb         Bb/C      F  
And you my love are gone

F             F/Eb
My room feels wrong
Dm            Db6 
The bed won't fit
F        F/E     Dm   Dm/C
I cannot seem to ope--rate
Bb         Bb/C      F  
And you my love are gone


[Chorus]
Bb                C
So glide away on soapy heels
F           F/E     Dm        Dm/C
And promise not to promise anymore
Bb                C
And if you come around again
F           F/E       Dm      Dm/C      Bb       Bb/C     F
Then I will take, then I will take the chain from off the door


[Verse]
F          F/Eb
I'll never say 
Dm         Db6
I'll never love 
F           F/E   Dm     Dm/C
But I don't say a lot of things 
Bb         Bb/C     F
And you my love are gone


[Chorus] x4
Bb                C
So glide away on soapy heels
F           F/E     Dm        Dm/C
And promise not to promise anymore
Bb                C
And if you come around again
F           F/E       Dm               Dm/C
Then I will take the chain from off the door


[Last chorus]
Bb                C
So glide away on soapy heels
F           F/E     Dm        Dm/C
And promise not to promise anymore
Bb
And if you come around again
Then I will take, then I will take, then I will take
The chain from off the door
