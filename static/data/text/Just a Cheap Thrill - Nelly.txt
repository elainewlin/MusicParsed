[Verse 1]

F#m                        D
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
    A                  E
It's Friday night and I won't be long
      F#m                  D
Gotta do my hair, I put my make-up on
    A                  E
It's Friday night and I won't be long


[Pre-Chorus]
     F#m      
Til I hit the dance floor
D
Hit the dance floor
A          E
I got all I need
    F#m
No I ain't got cash
D
No I ain't got cash
A              E
But I got you baby

[Verse 2]
F#m                           D
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
A                            E
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
F#m         D                A                  E
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
F#m               D                   A
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
                   E                       F#m
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
                   D
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
A                           E
See your pretty face run my fingers through your hair
   F#m       D        A        E
My lover, my life, my baby, my wife
    F#m          D
You left me, I'm tied
         A                       E
'Cause I know that it just ain't right


[Chorus]
                    F#m                D
I was thinking bout her, thinkin' bout me
              A                E
Thinkin' bout us, what we gon' be
    F#m            D                   A
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
       E
It was just a dream
    F#m           D                    A
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
       E
It was just a dream
   F#m              D  A  E
But I don't need no money
  F#m             D       A   
As long as I can feel the beat

[Bridge]
                                    D
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
       A                            E
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
                F#m                               D         E
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
            F#m                          D
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
       A                            E
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
            F#m                               D         E
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

[Chorus]
                    F#m                D
I was thinking bout her, thinkin' bout me
              A                E
Thinkin' bout us, what we gon' be
    F#m            D                   A
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
       E
It was just a dream
    F#m           D                    A
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
       E
It was just a dream

[Outro]

F#m         D       A   
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
       E
It was just a dream
F#m         D       A   
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
                   F#m
It was only just a dream
