C               G           Am               Em
Listen children to a story, that was written long ago..
 F               C              Dm              G
about a kingdom, on a mountain, and the valley folk below.
C               G               Am            Em
On the mountian was a treasure, buried deep beneath a stone..
F              C                    Dm                 G    C
And the valley people swore, they'd have it for their very own.

CHORUS:
C                      Em        F                    C
Go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat a friend.
C                    Em              F                 C
Do it in the name of Heaven, you can justify it in the end.
C                           Em       F                  C
There won't be any trumpets blowing, come the Judgement Day..
C                     F                             C
On the bloody morning after..one tin soldier rides away.

#2:
C              G              Am             Em
So, the people of the valley, sent a message up the hill..
F              C                Dm                G
asking for the buried treasure, tons of gold for which they'd kill.
C              G                  Am                Em
Came an answer from the kingdom, 'With our brothers we will share,
F               C                Dm              G      C
all the secrets of our mountain..all the riches buried there.'

#3:
C              G              Am             Em
Now the valley cried in anger, 'Mount your horses, draw your sword!'
F              C                     Dm                    G
And they killed the mountain people, sure they'd won their just reward.
C              G                  Am                Em
Now they stood beside the treasure, on the mountain dark and red..
F                     C                  Dm                   G      C
turned the stone and looked beneath it..'Peace on Earth,' was all it said.

CHORUS:
C                      Em        F                    C
Go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat a friend.
C                    Em              F                 C
Do it in the name of Heaven, you can justify it in the end.
C                           Em       F                  C
There won't be any trumpets blowing, come the Judgement Day..
C                     F                             C
On the bloody morning after..one tin soldier rides away.
