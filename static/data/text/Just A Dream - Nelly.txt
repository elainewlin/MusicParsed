  Dm                                 Bb
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think.
                                     F
Shoulda put it down. Shoulda got that ring.
                            C
Cuz I can still feel it in the air.

See her pretty face run my fingers through her hair.

   Dm                Bb

  Bb
And now I'm missin, wishin she'd pick up the phone.
   F
But she made a decision that she wanted to move one.
