[Verse 1]

Cadd9         G                G/F                 Cadd9
And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
             G        G/F      Cadd9
And she spoke words of wisdom


[Bridge]

                                        G
To the basement people, to the basement
        G/F              Cadd9
Many surprises await you
                                        G  Em7
In the basement people, in the basement


[Chorus]

Cadd9                                                   G
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
                     Dsus4                          Cadd9
Sick in the carseat, cause you're not up to going
                                                 G    Dsus4
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
