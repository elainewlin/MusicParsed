[Verse 1]

Am              G                C
I was scared of dentists and the dark,
Am              G                C
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations,
    Am     G                   C
Oh, all my friends are turning green,
           Am         G                 C
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams.


[Bridge]

Am   G    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Am G          C
Ooh, and they come unstuck


[Chorus]

Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide,
C                 Am
Taken away to the dark side,
G               C
I wanna be your left hand man.
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song and,
C                  Am
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
G                           C
You're gonna sing the words wrong


[Verse 2]

Am                 G                   C
There's this movie that I think you'll like,
     Am             G                C
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City,
     Am       G               C
This cowboy's running from himself.
    Am                G              C
And she's been living on the highest shelf


[Bridge]

Am   G    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Am G          C
Ooh, and they come unstuck


[Chorus]

Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide,
C                 Am
Taken away to the dark side,
G               C
I wanna be your left hand man.
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song and,
C                  Am
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
G                           C
You're gonna sing the words wrong


[Interlude]

Am                         G
I just wanna, I just wanna know,
C                               F
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay,
Am                         G
I just gotta, I just gotta know,
C                                F
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

  Am          G                C
I swear she's destined for the screen,
Am               G                 C
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh


[Chorus]

Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide,
C                 Am
