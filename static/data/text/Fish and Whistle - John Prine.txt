I been thinking lately about the people I meet
    C              G             D
The carwash on the corner and th hole in the street
    G                          C
The way my ankles hurt with my shoes on my feet
        G                D              G
And I'm wondering if I'm gonna to see tommorow

G                     C            D
Father forgive us for what we must do
C           G            D
You forgive us and we'll forgive you
G                                C
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
           G              D         G
Then we'll whistle and go fishin in heaven

I was in the army but I never dug a trench
C                 G             D
I used to bust my knuckles on a monkey wrench
       G                        C
Then I go to town and drink and give the girls a pinch
      G                D           G
But I don't think they ever really noticed me

G                         C             G
My very first job I said "thank you and please"
     C                G           D
They made me scrubb a parking lot down on my knees
G                    C
Then I got fired for being scared of bees
         G            D              G
And they only give me fifty cents an hour
