[Verse 1]
C         Am                       Em
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
C                   Am                         Em/B
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
C                           Am
He's on the British side in Georgia
     Em
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
C                       Am
Well he can keep all of Georgia
           N.C.
'Cause Theodosia, she's mine

[Chorus]
Am                        C
Love doesn't discriminate
                            Gsus4
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
    Am                    C
And we keep lovin' anyway
                F6
We laugh and we cry and we break
And we make our mistakes
    Am                  C
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
     Gsus4
When so many have tried
               Am          C
I'm willing to wait for it
                     F6
Then, I'm willing to wait for it

[Verse 2]
C                    Am                 Em
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher,
(preacher, preacher, preacher)
C                             Am                       Em/B
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya,
(teach ya, teach ya, teach ya)
C               Am
My mother was a genius (genius)
   Em
My father commanded respect, (respect, respect)
C                   Am
When they died they left no instructions,
N.C.
just a legacy to protect

[Chorus]
Am                         C
Death doesn’t discriminate
                            Gsus4
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
     Am                   C
And we keep living anyway
               F6
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
    Am                  C
And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
     Gsus4
When everyone who loves me has died
                     Am                        C
Then, I’m willing to wait for it (wait for it)
                    N.C.
Then I’m willing to wait for it

[Bridge]
Am
Wait for it, (wait for it,
Wait for it, wait for it)
C                                   Am
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
F
I am inimitable, I am an original
Am
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
C                                  Am
I am not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
F
I am not standing still,

[Bridge 2]
              Am
I am lying in wait
(Wait, wait, wait)
C                                Am
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
(Climb, climb, climb)
F
He got something to prove,
                       Am
he got nothing to lose
(Lose, lose, lose, lose)
C
Hamilton's pace is relentless,
             Am
he wastes no time
(Time, time, time)
F6                     Fmaj7
What is it like in his shoes?

[Chorus]
   C                      Am
Hamilton doesn’t hesitate
                 Em
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
    C                       Am
And he keeps winning anyway
               Em
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
    Am
And if there’s a reason
C6                      Am/B
He seems to thrive when so few survive,
                               Am                        C
Then Goddamnit— I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it)
               F
I'm willing to wait for it...

[Chorus]
Am
Life doesn't discriminate
C                           Gsus4
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
    Am                    C
And we keep living anyway
               F6
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
    Am                  C
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
     Gsus4             Em/G
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—

Wait for it, (wait for it, wait for it,

wait for it, wait for it, wait for it)
