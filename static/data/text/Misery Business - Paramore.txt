[Verse]

Fm                        Eb
  I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
Fm                         Db
  She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
Fm                 Eb
  It's a matter of time before we all run out...
Fm                      Db
  When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
Fm
  I waited eight long months
Eb
  She finally set him free
Fm                         Db
  I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Fm                     Eb
  Two weeks and we had caught on fire
             Fm                         Db
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

But I got him where I want him now
Db2               Ab                     Eb

   Fm             Eb
To steal it all away from you now

  But God does it feel so good

'Cause I got him where I want him now

  And if you could then you know you would

Fm                           Eb
  Second chances: they don't ever matter, people never change
Fm                             Db
  Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
Fm                      Eb
  And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
Fm                         Db
  I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way
Fm                             Eb
  Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Fm                       Db
  Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
Fm                                   Eb
  They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Fm                    Db
   Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
