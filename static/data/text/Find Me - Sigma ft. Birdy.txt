CAPO 1
[Intro] 
Am  Em  G  C

[Verse]
   Am                             Em
We said goodbye, that's what you told me once
         G                   C
So many times we've made our peace
    Am                       Em
But this is love, I'll never give you up
             G                    C
I know your love has come home to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Am             Em
Like a river, always running
G               C
I keep losing you
Am            Em
Like a fire, always burning
G                  C
I'll be here for you

[Chorus]
D               Em
If you're ready, heart is open
C
I'll be waiting, come find me
D                Em
If you're searching for forever
C
I'll be waiting, come find me

D         Em
I see you, here in the darkness
C
Blinding light right where your heart is
D               Em
If you're ready, heart is open
C
I'll be waiting, come find me

D  Em  C 
Come find me
D  Em  C 
Come find me

D         Em
I see you, here in the darkness

C
I'll be waiting, come find me

      Am                            Em
We've lost our way, that's what you told me once
      G                  C
But tears they come and go
Am                     Em
This is us, I'll never get enough
                G         C
It's taking losing you to know

If you're ready, heart is open

I'll be waiting, come find me
