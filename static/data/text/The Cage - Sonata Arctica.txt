  Em            Bm          C         A
A lifetime ago, with frozen eyes they closed the door
G          D/F#          Em       
Suddenly I realized what locks are for
G/B     C        A        G      D/F# 
No trusting them anymore, lights are out
Em               Bm  C        G
Empty the stare, innocent and unaware
            D/F#    Em             Bm
Dragged out from my home, my lair
   C          G        D/F#
Earmarked me, hurt me, burned me


C                           D                  G          C
The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
                          D              G                C
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
                                         D            Em
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free


                          C          G       
The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
              D           Em
Go around and see another side of the tree
C             G                    D    Em
Freedom has a meaning for me, howl with me


                  Bm  C         A
Fear in the dark, I advice you
                               G      D/F#
You can not see the eyes, they grow behind you
Em                Bm       C      A
It's my song they now sing to you
             G      D/F#
You stand no chance
        Em                 Bm      C        G
They'll kill for me, steal back my freedom, set me free 
        D/F#    Em
It's my minions versus thee
Bm        C          G         D/F#
Fiery the vengeance, hate will drain me


C                           D                  G          C
The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
                          D              G                C
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
                                         D            Em
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free


                          C          G       
The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
              D           Em
Go around and see another side of the tree
      C             G                      D   Em
All I want is to be untamed and free, howl and dream
                             C           G
The dream is alive, with the moon on the hills every night
               D           Em
Run around and see another side of the dream
C             G                         D
Freedom has a meaning for me, you can't tame me

                                         Bm   A
You will remember the day you crossed my path
                                         G     E/G# A
Leave me without a guard and you feel my wrath
                                             Bm       A
What you have done to me has made me bitter and cruel

I'll see that all the hate you spread returns to
G   E/G#  A   F#/A#    Bm
you,      you,      to you
