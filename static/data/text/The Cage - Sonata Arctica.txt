  Em            G/B         C         A
A lifetime ago, with frozen eyes they closed the door
G          D/F#          Em       
Suddenly I realized what locks are for
G/B     C        A        G      D/F# 
No trusting them anymore, lights are out
Em               G/B C        G
Empty the stare, innocent and unaware
            D/F#    Em             G/B
Dragged out from my home, my lair
   C          G        D/F#
Earmarked me, hurt me, burned me


C                           D                  G          C
The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
                          D              G                C
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
                                         D            Em
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free


                          C          G       
The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
              D/F#        Em
Go around and see another side of the tree
C             G                    D/F# Em             
Freedom has a meaning for me, howl with me


                  G/B C         A
Fear in the dark, I advice you
                               G      D/F#
You can not see the eyes, they grow behind you
Em                G/B      C      A
It's my song they now sing to you
             G      D/F#
You stand no chance
        Em                 G/B     C        G
They'll kill for me, steal back my freedom, set me free 
        D/F#    Em
It's my minions versus thee
G/B       C          G         D/F#
Fiery the vengeance, hate will drain me


C                           D                  G          C
The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
                          D              G                C
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
                                         D            Em
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free


                          C          G       
The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
              D/F#        Em
Go around and see another side of the tree
      C             G                      D/F# Em 
All I want is to be untamed and free, howl and  dream
                             C           G
The dream is alive, with the moon on the hills every night
               D/F#        Em
Run around and see another side of the dream
C             G                         D/F#
Freedom has a meaning for me, you can't tame me



A                                          Bm
  You will remember the day you crossed my  path
A                                          G  G#m
  Leave me without a guard and you feel my wrath
A                                             Bm
  What you have done to me has made me bitter and cruel
A                                                  
  I'll see that all the hate you spread returns to
G   G#m  A   A#m    Bm
you,     you,    to you



C                                  D           G     C
The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
                          D              G                C
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
                                         D            Em
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free


                          C          G       
The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night

Freedom has a meaning for me, you can't tame me
