[Verse]

Em7                    D               G    Cadd9
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
     Em7                   D               G    Cadd9
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in 
    Em7             D           G  Cadd9
Cos I got time while she got freedom
    Em7                      D               G    Cadd9
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even

Em7                  D               G    Cadd9
Her best days will be some of my worst 
Em7                D               G       Cadd9
  She finally met a man thats gonna put her first
      Em7                 D          G   Cadd9
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
Em7                          D              G    Cadd9
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven


[Chorus]

Cadd9          G                     D                   Em7
      What am I sposed to do when the best part of me was always you
Cadd9          G                      D                 Em7
      What am I sposed to say when I'm all choked up and your ok
Cadd9  G          D   Em7
    I'm falling to pieces
Cadd9  G          D   Em7 
    I'm falling to pieces 

Em7  D  G  Cadd9


[Verse]

     Em7                  D           G    Cadd9
They say bad things happen for a reason 
    Em7                D                G    Cadd9
But nowise words gonna stop the bleeding
    Em7                 D             G  Cadd9
Cos she's moved on while I'm still grieving 
    Em7                      D              G  Cadd9
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven

[Verse]

        Em7                        D
You got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
G                       Cadd9
You took your suitcase, I took the blame. 
        E m7                       D           G Cadd9
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh

Cos you left me with no love, no love to my name.

Em7                    D               G    Cadd9 
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
     Em7                   D               G   Cadd9
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in 
    Em7             D           G Cadd9
Cos I got time while she got freedom
    Em7                      D                  
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break

No, it don't break even, no!
