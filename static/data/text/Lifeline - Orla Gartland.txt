[Verse 1]
C
Nightmare,
Em D            G        C                Em D Bm
I  saw you standing, you were right there
         C
And I surrender,
Em   D            G     C        Em D Bm
Your face is just how I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
   C                Em       D
To think about it now, think about it now
G         C                  Em D     Bm
You threw me overboard, no hesitation
               C                  Em        D
And now you're tryin' to figure out, tryin' to figure out
G     C                         Em  D     Bm
  How to come back looking like a  savior

[Chorus]
    C Em D
And I,
    G     C
I'm gonna be just fine
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline
C Em D
I,
    G     C
I'm gonna be just fine
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline
C                    Em    D                     G    C   Em D Bm
Tell me one more time  how you're the one to save  it all
     C                     Em    D                       G    C
I'll tell you one more time  how you're the one that made  me fall
Em   D            Bm            C Em D G
  Oh I don't need your lifeline

[Verse 2]
C
Flashback,
Em D                  G        C               Em D Bm
Oh how I used to wish that you would come back
            C
But now I'm past hurt,
Em      D                        G      C            Em D Bm
So it's strange to see you crawl out of the woodwork

[Pre-Chorus]
   C                Em       D
To think about it now, think about it now
G         C                  Em D     Bm
You threw me overboard, no hesitation
               C                  Em        D
And now you're tryin' to figure out, tryin' to figure out
G     C                         Em  D     Bm
  How to come back looking like a  savior

[Chorus]
    C Em D
And I,
    G     C
I'm gonna be just fine
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline
C Em D
I,
    G     C
I'm gonna be just fine
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline
C                    Em    D                     G    C   Em D Bm
Tell me one more time  how you're the one to save  it all
     C                     Em    D                       G    C
I'll tell you one more time  how you're the one that made  me fall
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline

[Interlude]
Am7  Am9     Am7  Am9     G    G5   Dsus4  D

[Bridge]
            Am7    Am9   
And now you cast your  rope
          Am7          Am9   
Like it's some kind of joke
            G      G5          Dsus4 D
Like you forgot what  happened here
           Am7    Am9   
Why do you just show  up
            Am7          Am9   
When you're down on your luck
                G     G5        Dsus4 D
And when you've got no  ship to steer

[Chorus]
And I,
             C
I'm gonna be just fine
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline
C Em D
I,
    G     C
I'm gonna be just fine
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline
C                      Em    D                     G    C   Em D Bm
  Tell me one more time  how you're the one to save  it all
        C                     Em     D                       G    C
Oh I'll tell you one more time  that you're the one that made  me fall
Em   D            Bm
  Oh I don't need your lifeline

[Post-Chorus]
C         Em  D                    G   C
  No, no, no, I don't need your lifeline
        Em  D            Bm
No, no, no, I don't need your lifeline
C         Em  D                    G   C
  No, no, no, I don't need your lifeline
        Em  D            Bm
No, no, no, I don't need your lifeline
