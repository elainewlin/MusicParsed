[Verse 1]

F♯                         B
The path of love is never smooth
D♯m           C♯           B
But mine's continuous for you
          F♯                   B
You're the upper bound in the chains of my heart
          D♯m      C♯                     B
You're my Axiom of Choice, you know it's true
    B             F♯              C♯    D♯m
But lately our relation's not so well-defined
    B                             C♯
And I just can't function without you
     B            F♯               C♯           D♯m
I'll prove my proposition and I'm sure you'll find
        B                            C♯
We're a finite simple group of order two
[Verse 2]

F♯                 B
I'm losing my identity
D♯m         C♯            B
I'm getting tensor every day
    F♯                       B
And without loss of generality
         D♯m           C♯             B
I will assume that you feel the same way
      B            F♯                 C♯        D♯m
Since every time I see you, you just quotient out
    B                           C♯
The faithful image that I map into
    B                 F♯                   C♯    D♯m
But when we're one-to-one you'll see what I'm about
               B                            C♯
'Cause we're a finite simple group of order two
[Bridge]

    B               C♯
Our equivalence was stable,
  B              F♯              C♯      D♯m
A principal love bundle sitting deep inside
    B                                  C♯
But then you drove a wedge between our two-forms
    B                        C♯
Now everything is so complexified
[Verse 3]

     F♯                          B
When we first met, we simply connected
D♯m           C♯           B
My heart was open but too dense
    F♯                  B
Our system was already directed
   D♯m           C♯              B
To have a finite limit, in some sense
    B             F♯           C♯        D♯m
I'm living in the kernel of a rank-one map
     B                             C♯
From my domain, its image looks so blue,
       B             F♯              C♯     D♯m
'Cause all I see are zeroes, it's a cruel trap
            B                            C♯
But we're a finite simple group of order two
[Verse 4]

    F♯                          B
I'm not the smoothest operator in my class,
    D♯m            C♯            B
But we're a mirror pair, me and you,
   B              F♯               C♯      D♯m
So let's apply forgetful functors to the past
         B             F♯           B             F♯
And be a finite simple group, be a finite simple group,
           B                            C♯
Let's be a finite simple group of order two
(Why not three?)
     B             F♯               C♯       D♯m
I've proved my proposition now, as you can see,
   B                             C♯
So let's both be associative and free
    B       F♯                        C♯    D♯m
And by corollary, this shows you and I to be
B                         F♯
Purely inseparable. Q. E. D.
