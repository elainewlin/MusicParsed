[Verse: Shakira]

Bm           Em
I left a note on my bedpost
A                 D       
Said not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
Bm               Em
What I tend to do when it comes to you
A                  D           
I see only the good, selective memory

Bm                            Em
The way he makes me feel yeah, gotta hold on me
            A              D          
I've never met someone so different
Oh here we go
Bm                  Em
He a part of me now, he a part of me
     A 
So where you go I follow, follow, follow, oh


[Chorus 1]

Bm    A      Em     
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
           G           F#
I can't remember to forget you
Bm    A      G
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
           D              A/C#
I keep forgetting I should let you go
Bm            A                    Em            
But when you look at me, the only memory
        G              F#
Is us kissing in the moonlight
Bm    A      G
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Bm    Em    A
Ooooh
           D            A/C#
I can't remember to forget you
Bm    Em     A     D 
Ooooh


[Verse 2: Rihanna]

Bm          
I go back again
Em             
Fall off the train
A
Land in his bed
D      C
Repeat yesterday's mistakes
Bm                    Em            A
What I'm trying to say is not to forget
                    D     A/C#
You see only the good, selective memory

Bm
The way he makes me feel like
Em
The way he makes me feel
          A                D
I never seemed to act so stupid
C
Oh here we go
Bm                 Em
He a part of me now he a part of me

[Shakira]

     A 
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow, oh

Bm   A      G
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
           D               A/C#
I keep forgetting I should let you go
Bm            A                    Em
But when you look at me, the only memory
       G              F#
Is us kissing in the moonlight
Bm   A      G

[Bridge: Shakira]

  Bm                  Em  
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
   A                    D    A/C#
I do anything for that boy
    Bm                    Em
