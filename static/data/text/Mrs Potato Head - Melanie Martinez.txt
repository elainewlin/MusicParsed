C#m  B  A  E


[Verse]
              C#m
If you weren't born with it
                     B
You can buy a couple ornaments
                         A
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
                            E
Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it
C#m                                B
Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual
                            A
You can always call up a professional
                              E
They stick pins in you like a vegetable


[Pre-Chorus]
C#m
Kids forever, kids forever
B
Baby soft skin turns into leather
A
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
E
No one will love you if you're unattractive


[Chorus]
C#m
Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
B
is it true that pain is beauty?
A  
Does a new face come with a warranty?
E  
Will a pretty face make it better?
C#m
Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
B
How did you afford her surgery?
A
Do you swear you'll stay forever
E
Even if her face don't stay together
C#m                    B             A
Even if her face don't stay together


[Verse 2]
E                         C#m
If you want a little more confidence
                                         B
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense
                             A
All you need's a couple more condiments
                                        E
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments
     C#m
It's such a waste
                                  B
When little girls grow into their mother's face
                                     A
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
                                    E
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate


[Pre-Chorus]
C#m
Kids forever, kids forever
B
Baby soft skin turns into leather
A
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
E
No one will love you if you're unattractive


[Chorus]
C#m
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me,

  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
B
  How did you afford her surgery?
A
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
E
Even if her face don't stay together
C#m
Stay forever, stay forever
B
Even if her face don't stay together
A
Stay forever, stay forever
E
Even if her face don't stay together


C#m 
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
B 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
A  
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
E

C#m 
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me

C#m
Stay forever, stay forever
B
Even if her face don't stay together
A
Stay forever, stay forever
E
Even if her face don't stay together
