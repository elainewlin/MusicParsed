[Verse]

F                                       G
Something always brings me back to you.
C               Am
It never takes too long.
F                               G       C                                               Am
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

F                               G
You hold me without touch.
C                               Am
You keep me without chains.
F                                       G                                       C
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and 
Am
not feel your rain.


[Chorus]

F               G                       C
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into 
        Am
your gravity.
F                       G       C                                               Am
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
F                       C
But you're on to me and all over me.
F                                       G
You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
C                                       Am
When I thought that I was strong.
F                                       G               C                               Am
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.


[Chorus]

F                                       G
I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're 
F
everything I think I need here on
Am
The ground.
F                                                       G
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
F G C Am
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
