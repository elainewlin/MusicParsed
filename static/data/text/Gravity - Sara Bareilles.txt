[Intro]

C Am

[Verse]
F                            G
 Something always brings me back to you.
C                 Am
 It never takes too long.
F                  G
 No matter what I say or do
C                                        Am
 I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.
F                G
 You hold me without touch.
C                   Am
 You keep me without chains.
F                    G
 I never wanted anything so much
          C                          Am
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
     F         G
Set me free, leave me be.
                 C                             Am
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
     F           G       C                               Am
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
F                       C
But you're on to me and all over me.

[Verse]
F                    G
 You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
C                   Am
 When I thought that I was strong.
F                    G              C                      Am
 But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

[Chorus]
     F         G
Set me free, leave me be.
                 C                             Am
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
     F           G       C                               Am
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
F                       C
But you're on to me and all over me.

[Bridge]
F        G                     Am   G
 I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're
F       G                     Am       G
Everything I think I need here on the ground.
F                  G                      C               Am
 But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
F                   G                     C                Am
 The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
