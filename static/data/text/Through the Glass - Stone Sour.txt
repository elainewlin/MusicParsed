[Intro/Chorus]

                   Fsus2
I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Gsus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Am                     Am          Gsus4
Oh, God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
   Fsus2                 Gsus4                         Am
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
[Verse 1]

           Fsus2             Gsus4
How do you feel, that is the question
         Am                    Am              Gsus4
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
     Fsus2                          Gsus4
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
     Am                                Am                         Gsus4
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
   Fsus2                               Gsus4
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
  Am                                  Am   Gsus4
Remember what you're staring at is me
[Chorus]

                         Fsus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Gsus4
Don't know how much time has passed
                 Am                      Am          Gsus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
   Fsus2                 Gsus4                         Am
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
[Verse 2]

            Fsus2            Gsus4
How much is real? So much to question
      Am                          Am         Gsus4
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
   Fsus2                          Gsus4
We thought came from the heart it never did, right from the start
Am                         Am             Gsus4
Just listen to the noises (No more silent voices)
Fsus2                          Gsus4
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
  Am                                          Am   Gsus4
Remember it's just different from what you've seen
[Chorus]

                         Fsus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Gsus4
Don't know how much time has passed
                 Am                      Am          Gsus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
   Fsus2                 Gsus4                         Am
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head


[Bridge]

             Fsus2      Gsus4       Am
And it's the stars, the stars, that shine for you
             Fsus2      Gsus4       Am
And it's the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah
[Chorus]

                         Fsus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Gsus4
Don't know how much time has passed
           Am                      Am          Gsus4
Oh God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
   Fsus2                 Gsus4                         Am
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Ending]
             Fsus2      Gsus4       Am
And it's the stars, the stars, that shine for you
             Fsus2      Gsus4       Am
And it's the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah
             Fsus2      Gsus4       Am
And it's the stars, the stars, that shine for you
             Fsus2      Gsus4       Am
And it's the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah
Fsus2  Gsus4  Am
Fsus2
Oh, we're the stars
Gsus4                    Am
Oh, we're the stars that lie
