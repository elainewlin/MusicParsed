[Verse 1]
G                    D 
   Trees rocks birds ferns sea sky and 
Em             C
Rivers running free
G                 D
   All somehow in balance
C                Em
   Nature's harmony
G               D
   As in the beginning
Em                  C
   So it ever shall be
G        D                 G 
May this Balance stay with me

[Chorus]
     Em       D
Hail Cedar 
        G
Full of Grace
C              D
Blessed be the root 
       G
Of thy wilderness
Em       D
   Holy Hemlock rising
G   D   Em 
Evergreen
C       D              G
May the forest be with you

                  Em       D
May the forest be with you
               G 
May it be with me
                     C
From the smallest of pinecones 
       G           D
To the tallest of trees
   G  D  Em  D  C  
Ah oooh oooh oooh 
D                      G
May the forest be with you

[Verse 2]
      G           D      
That moody misty morning makes my 
Em           C
Heart skip a beat
     G               D 
That tree so old and silent I don't
C               Em 
Want to move my feet
G                       D
   They're the very definition of 
G   D   Em 
Glory
G         D               G
May this Wonder stay with me

[Chorus]
     Em       D
Hail Cedar 
        G
Full of Grace
C              D
Blessed be the root 
       G
Of thy wilderness
Em       D
   Holy Hemlock rising
G   D   Em 
Evergreen
C       D              G
May the forest be with you

                  Em       D
May the forest be with you
               G 
May it be with me
                     C
From the smallest of pinecones 
       G           D
To the tallest of trees
   G  D  Em  D  C  
Ah oooh oooh oooh 
D                      G
May the forest be with you

[Verse 3]
   G                 D   
No matter where you look there grows 
  Em             C
Another shade of green
    G                D
The nurse log is the mother to a 
C            Em
Wide diversity
G                     D
   They thrive in the rainfall, 
G   D   Em 
Abundantly
C         Am              D
May their fourish nourish me

[Bridge]
D                       C    G   G5
When we return to daily life so clean
        Am                Am                D
May we live the peaceful presence of these trees

[Chorus]
     Em       D
Hail Cedar 
        G
Full of Grace
C              D
Blessed be the root 
       G
Of thy wilderness
Em       D
   Holy Hemlock rising
G   D   Em 
Evergreen
C       D              G
May the forest be with you

                  Em       D
May the forest be with you
               G 
May it be with me
                     C
From the smallest of pinecones 
       G           D
To the tallest of trees
   G  D  Em  D  C  
Ah oooh oooh oooh 
D                      G
May the forest be with you

[Outro]
G                
As it was in the beginning, 
D
is now,
Em             D             
and ever shall be
C              D
Wild without end
