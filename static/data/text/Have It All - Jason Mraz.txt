[Verse 1]

                E
May you have auspiciousness and causes of success
                 C#m
May you have the confidence to always do your best
                A
May you take no effort in you being generous
                 B
Sharing what you can nothing more nothing less

                     E
And may you know the meaning of the word happiness
               C#m
May you always lead with the beating in your chest
               A
And may you be treated like an esteemed guest
               B
May you get to rest let you catch your breath

        C#m                        A                    E   B
May the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows, woah
        C#m                    A             E      B
May the road less paved be the one that you follow, woah

B
Here’s to the lives that you’re gonna change
C#m                                      A
Here’s to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it

E
Here’s to the good times we’re gonna have
B
You don’t need money you’ve got a free pass
C#m                                    A
Here’s to the fact that I’d be sad without you
I want you to have it all

May you be as fascinating as a slap bracelet
                 C#m
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
               A
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
             B
Having no possessions, though immeasurable wealth

              E
May you get a gold star on your next test
            C#m
May your educated guesses always be correct
                A
And may you win prizes shining like diamonds
               B
May you really own it each moment to the next
