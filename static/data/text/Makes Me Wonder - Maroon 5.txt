
[Verse]
Bm
I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Bm7
Struggled to memorize
A7
The way it felt between your thighs
F#
Pleasure that made you cry

Bm
Feels so good to be bad
Bm7
Not worth the aftermath, after that
A7
After that
F#
Try to get you back

[Prechorus]
G                     A
I still don't have the reason
G                     A
And you don't have the time
G
And it really makes me wonder
     A            Bb         Bm
If I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Bm                      Bm7
Give me something to believe in
          Em                   G       F#
Cause I don't believe in you anymore anymore
Bm              A                          G
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
F#
So this is goodbye

[Verse]
Bm
God damn my spinning head
Bm7
Decisions that made my bed
A7
Now I must lay in it
    F#
And deal with things I've left unsaid

Bm
I want to dive into you
Bm7
Forget what you're going through
  A7
I get behind, make your move
F#
Forget about the truth


[Prechorus]
G                     A
But I still don't have the reason
G                     A
And you don't have the time
G
And it really makes me wonder
     A            Bb         Bm
If I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Bm                      Bm7
Give me something to believe in
          Em                   G       F#
Cause I don't believe in you anymore anymore
Bm              A                          G
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
F#
So this is goodbye

Bm                         Bm7
And you told me how you're feeling
       Em                      G        F#
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
Bm              A                         G
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
         F#
(Oh no) So this is goodbye

[Bridge]
G
I've been here before
A
One day I'll wake up
       F#             Bm
And it won't hurt anymore
G
You caught me in a lie
A
I have no alibi
F#
The words you say don't have a meaning 'cause


[Prechorus]
G                     A
I still don't have the reason
G                     A
And you don't have the time
G
And it really makes me wonder
     A            Bb         Bm
If I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Bm                      Bm7
Give me something to believe in
          Em                   G       F#
Cause I don't believe in you anymore anymore
Bm              A                          G
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
F#
So this is goodbye

Bm                         Bm7
And you told me how you're feeling
       Em                      G        F#
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
Bm              A                         G
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
         F#
(Oh no) So this is goodbye
