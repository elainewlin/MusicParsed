[Verse]

Am
Like the legend of the phoenix
C
All ends with beginnings
Em
What keeps the planet spinning
D6
The force from the beginning


[Pre-chorus]

Am
We've come too far
C
To give up who we are
Em
So let's raise the bar
D6
And our cups to the stars


[Chorus]

Am
She's up all night till the sun
C
I'm up all night to get some
Em
She's up all night for good fun
D6
I'm up all night to get lucky
Am
We're up all night till the sun
C
We're up all night to get some
Em
We're up all night for good fun
D6
We're up all night to get lucky (x5)


[Verse]

Am
The present has no ribbon
C
Your gift keeps on giving
Em
What is this I'm feeling?
D6
If you want to leave, I'm with it


[Chorus]

Am    C   Em    D6
We’re up all night to get (x4)
Am
We’re up all night to get back together
C
We’re up all night (let’s get back together!)
Em
We’re up all night to get funky
D6
We’re up all night to get lucky
Am    C   Em    D6
We’re up all night to get lucky (x8)
