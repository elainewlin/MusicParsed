[Verse]

Am
 Baby, can’t you see

 A guy like you

 Should wear a warning

 I need a hit
Am
 Baby, give me it

 You’re dangerous

 I’m lovin’ it


[Pre-Chorus]

Am
Too high
Am
Can’t come down
   Am
Losing my head
         Am           
Spinning ‘round and ‘round
C E7                   Am
    Do you feel me now


[Chorus]

       Am
With a taste of your lips
    C
I’m on a ride
B7           Bb7
You're toxic I'm slipping under
       Am                     C
With a taste of a poison paradise
      F7
I’m addicted to you
          E7                     Am C
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
      F7
And I love what you do
          E7
Don’t you know that you’re toxic


[Instrumental]

Am  C  F7  E7


[Verse]

Am
 It’s getting late
Am
 To give you up
Am
 I took a sip
Am
 From my devil's cup
C
 Slowly
E7                  Am
It’s taking over me


[Pre-Chorus]

Am
Too high
Am
Can’t come down
Am
It’s in the air
         Am                
And it’s all around
C E7                    Am
    Can you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
