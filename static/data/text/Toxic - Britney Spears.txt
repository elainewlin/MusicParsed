[Verse]

Am
Baby, can’t you see
Am
I’m calling
Am
A guy like you
Am
Should wear a warning
C
It’s dangerous
E      Am
I’m fallin’

Am
There’s no escape
Am
I can’t wait
Am
I need a hit
Am
Baby, give me it
C
You’re dangerous
E           Am
I’m lovin’ it


[Pre-Chorus]

D
Too high
Am
Can’t come down
Am
Losing my head
Am                  C
Spinning ‘round and ‘round
E                  Am
Do you feel me now


[Chorus]

Am
With a taste of your lips
   C
I’m on a ride
F            E
You're toxic I'm slipping under
       Am                  C
With a taste of a poison paradise
     F
I’m addicted to you
E                             Am  C
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
C     F
And I love what you do
      E
Don’t you know that you’re toxic


[Instrumental]

Am  C  F  E


[Verse]

Am
It’s getting late
Am
To give you up
Am
I took a sip
Am
From my devil's cup
C
Slowly
E
It’s taking over me


[Pre-Chorus]

D
Too high
Am
Can’t come down
Am
It’s in the air
Am                C
And it’s all around
E                  Am
Can you feel me now


[Chorus]

Am
With a taste of your lips
   C
I’m on a ride
F            E
You're toxic I'm slipping under
       Am                  C
With a taste of a poison paradise
     F
I’m addicted to you
          E                      Am  C
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
C     F
And I love what you do
      E
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
