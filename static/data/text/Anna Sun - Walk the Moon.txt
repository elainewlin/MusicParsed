Screen falling off the door / Door hanging off the hinges
                                            Gm
My feet are still sore / My back is on the fringes
                                    F
We tore up the walls / We slept on couches

We lifted this house / We lifted this house

Fire-crackers in the east / My car parked south

Your hands on my cheeks / Your shoulder in my mouth
                                            F
I was up against the wall on the west, mezzanine
                                       D#
We rattle this town / We rattle this scene

Gm                     D#
What do you know? This house is falling apart
A#                      F
What can I say? This house is falling apart
Gm                     D#
We got no money, but we got heart
F
We're gonna rattle this ghost town

Live my life without
F
Station wagon rides
Gm
Fumbling around the back
F
Not one seatbelt on
A#
Wait for summertime
F
Coming up for air
Gm
Now it's all awash
F
Now it's all awash
A#
Live my life without

Coming up for air

Now it's all a wash

I want everyone

Racing down the hill

I am faster than you

Wait for summertime

Wait for summertime
