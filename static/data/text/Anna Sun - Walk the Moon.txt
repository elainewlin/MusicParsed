Bb                                                   F
Screen falling off the door / Door hanging off the hinges
                                            Gm
My feet are still sore / My back is on the fringes
                                    F
We tore up the walls / We slept on couches
                                       Bb
We lifted this house / We lifted this house
                                           F
Fire-crackers in the east / My car parked south
                                              Gm
Your hands on my cheeks / Your shoulder in my mouth
                                            F
I was up against the wall on the west, mezzanine
                                       Eb
We rattle this town / We rattle this scene
           Bb
O, Anna Sun!
Eb           Bb
O, Anna Sun!
Gm                     Eb
What do you know? This house is falling apart
Bb                      F
What can I say? This house is falling apart
Gm                     Eb
We got no money, but we got heart
F
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
Bb                                                  F
Screen falling off the door / Door hanging off the hinges

We're gonna rattle this ghost town
Bb
Live my life without
F
Station wagon rides
Gm
Fumbling around the back
F
Not one seatbelt on
Bb
Wait for summertime
F
Coming up for air
Gm
Now it's all awash
F
Now it's all awash
Bb
Live my life without
F
Coming up for air
Gm
Now it's all a wash
F
I want everyone
Bb
Racing down the hill
F
I am faster than you
Gm
Wait for summertime
F
Wait for summertime
Eb         Bb
O, Anna Sun!
