[Verse 1]

C#m
All my friends tell me I should move on
C#m
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
A     C#m
Ahhh, that's how you sang it
C#m
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
C#m
Even though you're not here, won't move on
A     C#m
Ahhh, that's how we played it


[Pre-chorus]

                A                     C#m
And there's no remedy for memory your face is
               B                  A
Like a melody, it won't leave my head
              A 
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
      C#m
That everything is fine
    B
But I wish I was dead


[Chorus]

C#m                    B
Every time I close my eyes                              
     F#m               C#m                                
It's like a dark paradise                               
           A                                            
No one compares to you                                  
     C#m                       B                         
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side 

C#m                    B
Every time I close my eyes                              
     F#m               C#m                                
It's like a dark paradise                               
           A                                            
No one compares to you                                  
     C#m                       B                         
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side 


[Verse 2]

C#m
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
C#m
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
A     C#m
Ahhh, that's why I stay here


[Pre-Chorus]

                A                     C#m
And there's no remedy for memory your face is
               B                  A
Like a melody, it won't leave my head
              A 
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
      C#m
That everything is fine
    B
But I wish I was dead


[Chorus]

C#m                    B
Every time I close my eyes                              
     F#m               C#m                                
It's like a dark paradise                               
           A                                            
No one compares to you                                  
     C#m                       B                         
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
C#m                    B
Every time I close my eyes
     F#m               C#m
It's like a dark paradise
            A
No one compares to you
    C#m                 B
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight


[Post-Chorus]

          A           C#m
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
               A                    C#m
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
          A           C#m     
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
               A                    C#m
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight


[Bridge]

A
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
C#m
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
A
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
C#m              G#
Telling me I'm fine


[Chorus]

C#m                    B
Every time I close my eyes                              
     F#m               C#m                                
It's like a dark paradise                               
           A                                            
No one compares to you                                  
     C#m                       B                         
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
C#m                    B
Every time I close my eyes
     F#m               C#m
It's like a dark paradise
            A
No one compares to you
    C#m                 B
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight


[Outro]

          A           C#m
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
               A                    C#m
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
          A           C#m     
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
               A                    C#m
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
