[Verse 1]

F♯m       A
Today is gonna be the day
              E                  B7sus4
That they're gonna throw it back to you
F♯m          A
By now you should've somehow
    E                B7sus4
Realised what you gotta do
F♯m                   A
I don't believe that anybody
 E           B7sus4            D  E  B7sus4
Feels the way I do about you now
[Verse 2]

F♯m           A
Backbeat the word is on the street
          E                 B7sus4
That the fire in your heart is out
F♯m              A
I'm sure you've heard it all before
          E             B7sus4
But you never really had a doubt
F♯m                   A       E
I don't believe that anybody feels
           B7sus4            F♯m  A  E  B7sus4
The way I do about you now
[Bridge]

     D                E            F♯m
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
     D                E                F♯m
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
 D              E               A     E/G  F♯m
There are many things that I would like to say to you
       A      B7sus4
But I don't know how
[Chorus]

         D    F♯m  A
Because maybe
        F♯m                   D        F♯m  A
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
     F♯m   D  F♯m  A
And after all
           F♯m    D  F♯m  A  F♯m      A
You're my wonderwall
[Verse 3]

F♯m        A
Today was gonna be the day
             E                  B7sus4
But they'll never throw it back to you
F♯m         A
By now you should've somehow
    E                    B7sus4
Realised what you're not to do
F♯m                   A
I don't believe that anybody
E            B7sus4
Feels the way I do
           F♯m  A  E  B7sus4
About you now
[Bridge]

     D                  E              F♯m
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
     D                   E             F♯m
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
 D              E               A     E/G  F♯m
There are many things that I would like to say to you
       A      B7sus4
But I don't know how
[Chorus]

        D    F♯m  A
I said maybe
        F♯m                  D        F♯m  A
You're gonna be the one who saves me?
     F♯m   D  F♯m  A
And after all
           F♯m   D   F♯m  A  F♯m
You're my wonderwall
        D             F♯m   A
I said maybe (I said maybe)
        F♯m                  D        F♯m  A
You're gonna be the that who saves me?
     F♯m   D  F♯m  A
And after all
           F♯m   D   F♯m  A  F♯m
You're my wonderwall
        D             F♯m   A
I said maybe (I said maybe)
        F♯m                   D               F♯m      A
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        F♯m                   D               F♯m      A
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        F♯m                   D               F♯m      A  F♯m
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
