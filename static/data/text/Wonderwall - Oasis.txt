[Verse 1]

Em       G
Today is gonna be the day
              D                  A7sus4
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em          G
By now you should've somehow
    D                A7sus4
Realised what you gotta do

Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
 D           A7sus4            C  D  A7sus4
Feels the way I do about you now


[Verse 2]

Em           G
Backbeat the word is on the street
          D                 A7sus4
That the fire in your heart is out
Em              G
I'm sure you've heard it all before
          D             A7sus4
But you never really had a doubt
Em                   G       D
I don't believe that anybody feels
           A7sus4            Em  G  D  A7sus4
The way I do about you now


[Bridge]

     C                D            Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
     C                D                Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
 C              D
There are many things that I would
Em      D  G
Like to say to you
       D      A7sus4
But I don't know how


[Chorus]

         C    Em  G
Because maybe
        Em                   C        Em  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
     Em   C  Em  G
And after all
           Em    C  Em  G  Em      G
You're my wonderwall


[Verse 3]

Em        G
Today was gonna be the day
             D                  A7sus4
But they'll never throw it back to you
Em         G
By now you should've somehow
    D                    A7sus4
Realised what you're not to do
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
D            A7sus4
Feels the way I do
           Em  G  D  A7sus4
About you now


[Bridge]

     C                  D              Em
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
     C                   D             Em
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
 C              D               Em     D  G
There are many things that I would like to say to you
       D      A7sus4
But I don't know how


[Chorus]

        C    Em  G
I said maybe
        Em                  C        Em  G
You're gonna be the one who saves me?
     Em   C  Em  G
And after all
           Em   C   Em  G  Em
You're my wonderwall
        C             Em   G
I said maybe (I said maybe)
        Em                  C        Em  G
You're gonna be the that who saves me?
     Em   C  Em  G
And after all
           Em   C   Em  G  Em
You're my wonderwall
        C             Em   G
I said maybe (I said maybe)
        Em                   C               Em      G
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        Em                   C               Em      G
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        Em                   C               Em      G  Em
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
