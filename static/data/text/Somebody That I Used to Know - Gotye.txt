[Verse]

Dm       C              Dm      C     Dm   C 
Now and then I think of when we were together
Dm            C                Dm     C        Dm  C          
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Dm     C                  Dm         C      
Told myself that you were right for me
Dm           C             Dm      C
But felt so lonely in your company
Dm            C                Dm       C     Dm    C  
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


[Verse]

Dm             C           Dm      C       Dm    C 
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Dm         C            Dm       
Like resignation to the end
C          Dm       C    Dm    C
Always the end
Dm          C                  Dm         C      
So when we found that we could not make sense
Dm         C                 Dm        C
Well you said that we would still be friends
Dm          C              Dm       C       Dm    C  
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over


[Chorus]

Dm      C              Bb     C
But you didn't have to cut me off
Dm        C            Bb
Make out like it never happened
         C          Dm
And that we were nothing
    C             Bb       C
And I don't even need your love
         Dm              C
But you treat me like a stranger
          Bb       C
And that feels so rough

Dm    C              Bb      C
You didn't have to stoop so low
Dm         C                   Bb 
Have your friends collect your records
          C           Dm
And then change your number
  C                  Bb          C
I guess that I don't need that though
Dm               C              Bb      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


[Interlude]

Dm               C              Bb      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Dm               C              Bb      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse]

Dm       C             Dm                  C          Dm  C 
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Dm          C                Dm              C        Dm   C 
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
C            
And I don't wanna live that way
C         
Reading into every word you say
C                   
You said that you could let it go
C                                            
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know


[Chorus]

Dm      C              Bb     C
But you didn't have to cut me off
Dm        C            Bb
Make out like it never happened
         C          Dm
And that we were nothing
    C             Bb       C
And I don't even need your love
         Dm              C
But you treat me like a stranger
          Bb       C
And that feels so rough

Dm    C              Bb      C
You didn't have to stoop so low
Dm         C                   Bb 
Have your friends collect your records
          C           Dm
And then change your number
  C                  Bb          C
I guess that I don't need that though
Dm               C              Bb      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


[Outro]

    Dm      C    Bb          C
Somebody...       I used to know
    Dm      C       Bb        C
Somebody...  That I used to know 
    Dm      C    Bb          C
Somebody...       I used to know
    Dm                         C            Bb        C
Somebody... (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Dm    C   Bb       C
I used to know  
Dm   C        Bb       C
That I used to know     
Dm    C   Bb       C
I used to know             
Dm        C   Bb   C
Somebody...
