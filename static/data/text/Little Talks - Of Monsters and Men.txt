[Intro]

Am   F       C   G
                 Hey!
Am   F       C   G
                 Hey!
Am   F       C   G
                 Hey!
Am   F       C   G


[Verse 1]

Am               F               C                  
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
    Am                 F                C
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
     Am           F               C
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
          Am            F                 C
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Am          F          C
Some days I can't even trust myself
       Am           F            C
It's killing me to see you this way


[Chorus]

                   Am       F    
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am    F        C 
Our bodies safe to shore


[Interlude]

Am   F       C   G
                 Hey!
Am   F       C   G
                 Hey!
Am   F       C   G
                 Hey!
Am   F       C   G


[Verse 2]

            Am       F                C                  
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Am              F               C
Tell her that I miss our little talks
Am              F        C
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
    Am             F                   C
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Am        F               C
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
      Am             F                 C
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear


[Chorus]

                   Am        F         
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   F         C     G
Our bodies safe to shore  Hey!
Am                F      C     G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Am              F          C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Am       F        
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   F        C     G
Our bodies safe to shore 


[Verse 3]

Am
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
Am 
All that's left is a ghost of you
           Am
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. 
     Am
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.
    Am          F           C 
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
  Am            F       C      G
I see you when I fall asleep. Hey!


[Chorus]

Am                F      C     G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Am              F          C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Am       F        
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   F         C     G
Our bodies safe to shore 

Am                F      C     G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Am              F          C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Am       F        
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   F         C     G
Our bodies safe to shore 


[Ending]

                   Am       F    
'Cause though the truth may vary
       C         G
This ship will carry
      Am     F       C 
Our bodies safe to shore

                   Am       F    
'Cause though the truth may vary
       C         G
This ship will carry
      Am     F       C 
Our bodies safe to shore
