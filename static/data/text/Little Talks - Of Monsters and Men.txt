[Intro]

Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G


[Verse 1]

Am               Fmaj7           C                  
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
    Am                 F                C
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
     Am           Fmaj7           C
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
          Am            F                 C
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Am          Fmaj7      C
Some days I can't even trust myself
       Am           F            C
It's killing me to see you this way


[Chorus]

                   Am       Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am    F        C 
Our bodies safe to shore


[Interlude]

Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G


[Verse 2]

            Am       Fmaj7            C                  
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Am              Fmaj7           C
Tell her that I miss our little talks
Am              Fmaj7    C
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
    Am             Fmaj7               C
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Am        Fmaj7           C
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
      Am             Fmaj7             C
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear


[Chorus]

                   Am        Fmaj7     
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   Fmaj7     C     G
Our bodies safe to shore  Hey!
Am                Fmaj7  C     G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Am              Fmaj7      C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Am       Fmaj7    
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   Fmaj7    C     G
Our bodies safe to shore 


[Verse 3]

Am
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
Am 
All that's left is a ghost of you
           Am
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. 
     Am
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.
    Am          Fmaj7       C 
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
  Am            Fmaj7   C      G
I see you when I fall asleep. Hey!


[Chorus]

Am                Fmaj7  C     G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Am              Fmaj7      C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Am       Fmaj7    
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   Fmaj7     C     G
Our bodies safe to shore 

Am                Fmaj7  C     G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Am              Fmaj7      C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Am       Fmaj7    
'Cause though the truth may vary
    C           G
This ship will carry
      Am   Fmaj7     C     G
Our bodies safe to shore 


[Ending]

                   Am       Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary
       C         G
This ship will carry
      Am     F       C 
Our bodies safe to shore

                   Am       Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary
       C         G
This ship will carry
      Am     F       C 
Our bodies safe to shore
