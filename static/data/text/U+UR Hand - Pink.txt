[Verse 1]

E5                         G5  D5   E5
Check it out goin' out on the late night
                                G5  D5   E5
lookin' tight feeling nice, it's a cock fight
                               G5  D5 E5      F5
I can tell I just know that it's going down, tonight


[Pre-Chorus 1]

E5                           G5  D5   E5
at the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
                             G5  D5   E5
at the bar six shots just beginnin'
                                 G5   D5  E5
that's when dickhead put his hands on me
    F5     F5 D5

[Chorus]

Em                    C
I'm not here for your entertainment
 G                    D                Em
you don't really wanna mess with me tonight
                      C
just stop and take a second
G                    D                 Am
I was fine before you walked into my life
                           Em
'cause you know it's over, before it began
Am                     C
keep your drink just give me the money
G                       D     Em/E5   G5  D5
it's just you and your hand tonight
E5      G5 D5


[Verse 2]

E5                   G5        D5      E5
midnight I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
                        G5          D5       E5

                       G5        D5  E5

[Pre-Chorus 2]

                 G5    D5     E5

[Bridge]

E5                                        G5       D5    E5
you're in the corner with your boys, you bet them five bucks

                                         G5      D5    E5
you'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck
                              G5       D5    E5
we didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
                     G5     D5    E5
so quit spilling your drinks on me


[Interlude]

(No chord - Spoken)
you know you are

but you’re going home alone

[Chorus]

Em                     C
I'm not here for your entertainment
 G                    D                 Em
you don't really wanna mess with me tonight
              C
just stop and take a second
G                    D                Am
I was fine before you walked into my life
                            Em
'cause you know it's over, before it began
Am                  C
keep your drink just give me the money
G                     D
it's just you and your hand tonight

(E5)
