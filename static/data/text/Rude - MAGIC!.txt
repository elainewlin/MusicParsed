CAPO 1
F          G                    Am              Am
Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
F          G                    Am              Am
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
F          G                    C              Am
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand To ask you a question
F          G                    C              Am
Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man yeah yeah
Pre-Chorus:
 F                                G
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
     C/E                  Am
say yes, say yes, Cause I need to know
F                                G
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die
     C                    Am
Tough luck my friend but the answer is no!
Chorus:
 F             G          C              Am
Why you gotta be so rude? , Don't you know I'm human too
F             G          C              Am
why you gotta be so rude I'm gonna marry her anyway
F             G

C              Am
marry that girl -yeah no matter what you say-
F                 G

C              Am     F      G    C     Am
Why you gotta be so rude

F          G                    C                Am
