[Chorus]

         E                       B
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
          G#m                F#
All of my change I spent on you
                E
Where have the times gone
           B                       G#m                   F#
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?


[Verse]

      E                              B     
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
                         G#m
The people we used to be
                            F#
It's even harder to picture
                               E
That you're not here next to me
                                B
You say it's too late to make it
                          G#m
But is it too late to try?
                               F#
And in our time that you wasted
                               E
All of our bridges burned down


[Pre-Chorus]

                     B
I've wasted my nights
                         G#m
You turned out the lights
                 F#
Now I'm paralyzed
                      E                        B
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
              G#m              F#
But even the sun sets in paradise


[Chorus]

         E                       B
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
          G#m                F#
All of my change I spent on you
                E
Where have the times gone
           B                       G#m                   F#
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?


[Verse]

             E               B
If happy ever after did exist
                 G#m                  F#
I would still be holding you like this
                E                    B
All those fairytales are full of shit
                       G#m             F#
One more fucking love song I'll be sick


E                                B
You turned your back on tomorrow
                          G#m
Cause you forgot yesterday
                             F#
I gave you my love to borrow
                      E
But just gave it away
                               B
You can't expect me to be fine
                           G#m
I don't expect you to care
                           F#
I know I've said it before
                                   E
But all of our bridges burned down


[After prechorus and chorus]

                E
Now I'm at a payphone...


[Rap]
                                  
[Wiz Khalifa]   Man fuck that shit
B                                                     
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
G#m                                                   
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
F#
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning
E
And all of my cars start with the push up a button
B
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
G#m
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
F#
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
E
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
B
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
G#m
So you talk about who you see at the top
F#
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
E
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
B
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
G#m
Now ask me who they want
                               F#
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you
