[Verse]

             Ab
When we were young, we used to live so close to it
               Bb                 Cm       Bb
And you were scared and you were beautiful
           Ab  
I want to peer over the edge and see in death
           Bb           Cm Bb
If we are always the same
      Ab              Bb          Cm                 Bb
Oh, I fear that no love will ever be like this again
          Ab                       Bb         Cm  Bb
Cuz your love kept me alive and it made me insane

            Ab
There were moments when it seemed okay
          Bb
(But I go back alone)
             Cm
Where do you go? Where do you stay?
      Bb
(I go back alone)
            Ab
There was a time when the music would play
   Bb   Cm 
Oh-oh-oh


[Chorus]

    Bb          Ab                          Bb
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Cm
Taking all my time
     Bb    Ab
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
            Bb     Cm 
Welcome to reality
