[Verse 1]
Am               C                     Em  F
  Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
Am                 C                     Em  F
  What else can we do when we're feeling low?
Am          C                      Em  F
  So take a deep breath and let it go
Am                 C                   Em  F
  You shouldn't be drowning on your own


[Pre-Chorus]
            Am          C              Em         F
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
      Am        C         Em  F
Into cold, cold water for you
              Am      C            Em        F
And although time may take us into different places
         Am     C       Em      F
I will still be patient with you
                   G
And I want you to know


[Chorus]
             Am C Em F
I won't let go
             Am  C      Em  F
I'll be your lifeline tonight
             Am C Em F
I won't let go
             Am  C      Em  F
I'll be your lifeline tonight


[Verse 2]
Am                 C                   Em   F
  Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
Am            C                 Em  F
  It's how we learn, how we grow
Am                     C               Em  F
  And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
Am                 C                   Em  F
  You shouldn't be fighting on your own


[Pre-Chorus]
            Am          C              Em         F
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
      Am        C         Em  F
Into cold, cold water for you
              Am      C            Em        F
And although time may take us into different places
         Am     C       Em      F
I will still be patient with you
                   G
And I want you to know


[Chorus]
             Am C Em F
I won't let go
             Am  C      Em  F
I'll be your lifeline tonight
             Am C Em F
I won't let go
             Am  C      Em  F
I'll be your lifeline tonight


[Bridge]
Am
Come on, come on
C                     Em  F
Standing on a rocking boat
                     Am C
I just wanna stay afloat
           Em F
I'm all alone
Am        C                          Em F
Now, now, someone come and take me home
                          Am  C
Someone come and take my soul
                Em F
I need you to know


[Chorus]
             Am C Em F
I won't let go
             Am  C      Em  F
I'll be your lifeline tonight
             Am C Em F
I won't let go
             Am  C      Em  F
I'll be your lifeline tonight


[Outro]
              Am C Em F
I won't let go
              Am C Em F
I won't let go
