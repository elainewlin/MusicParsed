[Verse 1]

Fm           E♭              B♭
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Fm             E♭            B♭
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
A♭         E♭           B♭
Lights out solo in the blue
      Fm        E♭   B♭
Before I found you
[Pre-Chorus]

Fm          A♭       E♭        B♭
Days passed slowly, lost and low
    Fm      A♭        E♭           B♭
You gave me hope and now there's only
[Chorus]

Fm                  E♭
Blood running in my veins
                B♭
I've never been here before
          Fm                   E♭
And I got love falling like the rain
                 B♭
I never could've asked for more
      A♭              Cm
I got so much soul inside my bones
B♭                   E♭/G
Take a look at me now
    Fm                   E♭
I'm young forever in the sun
           B♭
Ever since you came
                  Fm  E♭  B♭  B♭
I'm living ultralife
                  Fm  E♭  B♭ B♭
I'm living ultralife
                  Fm  E♭  B♭ B♭
I'm living ultralife
[Verse 2]

Fm            E♭               B♭
Turn down the voice inside my head
                  Fm
Cause heaven only knows
       E♭              B♭
Why we feel this emptiness
           Fm         E♭            B♭
But I will climb out, find another view
         Fm       E♭  B♭
Now I've found you
[Pre-Chorus]

Fm          A♭       E♭        B♭
Days passed slowly, lost and low
    Fm      A♭        E♭           B♭
You gave me hope and now there's only
[Chorus]

Fm                  E♭
Blood running in my veins
                B♭
I've never been here before
          Fm                    E♭
And I got love falling like the rain
                 B♭
I never could've asked for more
      A♭              Cm
I got so much soul inside my bones
B♭                   E♭/G
Take a look at me now
    Fm                   E♭
I'm young forever in the sun
           B♭
Ever since you came I'm living ultralife
A♭                  B♭
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
A♭                  B♭
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
[Bridge]

A♭                        E♭/G
Found me on a basement floor
B♭                         E♭/G
Back when I had lost it all
A♭                            E♭/G
Told me what the fight was for
B♭                       E♭/G  A♭
And I'm not giving up no more
                      E♭/G
You elevate the life in me
B♭                     E♭/G
Illuminate the in-between
A♭                         E♭/G
Forever gonna feel this free
B♭                       E♭/G
And I'm not giving up now
