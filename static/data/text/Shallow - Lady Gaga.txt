   Or do you need more?
C                                 G         D

[Chorus]
Am                    D/F#
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G           D/F#     Em
I’ll never meet the ground
Am                         D/F#
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
      G            D/F#    Em
We’re far from the shallow now

[Post–Chorus]
Am               D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G         D             Em
   In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am               D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
         G            D       Em
   We’re far from the shallow now

[Chorus]
Am                    D
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G           D        Em
I’ll never meet the ground
Am                         D   
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
      G            D       Em
We’re far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus]
Am               D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G         D             Em
   In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am               D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
         G            D       Em
   We’re far from the shallow now
