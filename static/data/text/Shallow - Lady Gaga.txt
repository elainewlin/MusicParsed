Em7       D/F#      G
  Tell me something girl...
C                       C G    D
  Are you happy in this modern world?
Em7     D/F#     G
  Or do you need more?
C                                C   G     D
  Is there something else you’re searching for?

[Pre-Chorus - Bradley]
Em7 D/F# G
I’m fall-in'
C                         G       D           
  In all the good times I find myself longin' 
Em7 D/F# G
    for  change
C                        G       D    
  And in the bad times I fear myself

  Tell me something boy...
C                            C    G    D
  Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void
Em7     D/F#     G
  Or do you need more?
C                          C  G   D
  Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore

I’m fall-in'

[Chorus - Lady Gaga]
Am                    D/F#
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G           D/F#     Em
I’ll never meet the ground
Am                         D/F#
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
      G            D/F#    Em
We’re far from the shallow now

[Both]
Am              D/F#
  In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G         D             Em
  In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am              D/F#
  In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
        G            D       Em
  We’re far from the shallow now

[Chorus - Lady Gaga]
Am                    D
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G           D        Em
I’ll never meet the ground
Am                         D   
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
      G            D       Em
We’re far from the shallow now

[Both]
Am              D/F#
  In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G         D             Em
  In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am              D/F#
  In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
        G            D       Em
  We’re far from the shallow now
