[Verse 1]
Bm          D            A
I'm waking up to ash and dust
          E                    Bm
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
             D               A    E
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Bm          D            A                 E
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
Bm        D              A
This is it, the apocalypse
E
Whoa
[Chorus 1]
E              Bm             D
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
A                  E
Enough to make my systems blow
Bm                     D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
A                      E
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Bm     D         A            E
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Bm     D         A            E
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
[Verse 2]
Bm           D            A
I raise my flags, don my clothes
          E                    Bm
It's a revolution, I suppose
              D                  A
We're painted red to fit right in
E
Whoa
Bm          D            A                 E
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
Bm        D              A
This is it, the apocalypse
E
Whoa
[Chorus 2]
E              Bm           D
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
A                  E
Enough to make my systems blow
Bm                     D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
A                      E
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Bm     D         A            E
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Bm     D         A            E
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
[Bridge]
Bm          D   A           E
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Bm          D     A             E
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
[Chorus 3]
E              Bm             D
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
A                  E
Enough to make my systems blow
Bm                     D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
A                      E
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Bm     D         A            E
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Bm     D         A            E
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
