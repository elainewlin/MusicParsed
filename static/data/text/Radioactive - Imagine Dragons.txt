[Verse 1]

Am          C            G
I'm waking up to ash and dust
          D                    Am
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
             C               G    D
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Am          C            G                 D
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
Am        C              G
This is it, the apocalypse
D
Whoa


[Chorus 1]

D              Am             C
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
G                  D
Enough to make my systems blow
Am                     C
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
G                      D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Am     C         G            D
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Am     C         G            D
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive


[Verse 2]

Am           C            G
I raise my flags, don my clothes
          D                    Am
It's a revolution, I suppose
              C                  G
We're painted red to fit right in
D
Whoa
Am          C            G                 D
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
Am        C              G
This is it, the apocalypse
D
Whoa


[Chorus 2]

D              Am           C
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
G                  D
Enough to make my systems blow
Am                     C
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
G                      D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Am     C         G            D
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Am     C         G            D
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive


[Bridge]

Am          C   G           D
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Am          C     G             D
Deep in my bones, straight from inside


[Chorus 3]

D              Am             C
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
G                  D
Enough to make my systems blow
Am                     C
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
G                      D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Am     C         G            D
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Am     C         G            D
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
