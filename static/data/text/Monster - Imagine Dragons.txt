CAPO 1

[Verse]

Em            G
 Ever since I could remember,
D            A
 Everything inside of me,
Em      G            D         A
 Just wanted to fit in (oh oh oh oh)
Em             G   
 I was never one for pretenders,
D                 A
 Everything I tried to be,
Em       G              D       A
 Just wouldn't settle in (oh oh oh oh)


[Pre-Chorus]

Em                G  
 If I told you what I was,
D                          A
 Would you turn your back on me?
Em                 G
 And if I seem dangerous,
D                  A
 Would you be scared?
Em                   G
 I get the feeling just because,
   D                             A
 Everything I touch isn't dark enough
Em          G               D
 If this problem lies in me


[Chorus]

     Em         G            D            A
 I'm only a man with a chamber who's got me,
     Em             G         D             A
 I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
    Em         G
 A monster, A monster,
       D                A
 I've turned into a monster,
    Em         G 
 A monster, A monster,
       D                   A
 And it keeps getting stronger.


[Verse]

Em         G
 Can I clear my conscience,
   D         A
 If I'm different from the rest,
Em      G                 D         A
 Do I have to run and hide? (oh oh oh oh)
Em          G
 I never said that I want this,
  D          A
 This burden came to me,
Em         G                   D        A
 And it's made it's home inside (oh oh oh oh)


[Pre-Chorus]

Em               G
 If I told you what I was,
 D                     A
 Would you turn your back on me?
Em                G
 And if I seem dangerous,
 D                A
 Would you be scared?
Em                    G
 I get the feeling just because,
    D                            A
 Everything I touch isn't dark enough
Em           G             D
 If this problem lies in me


[Chorus]

      Em        G           D             A
 I'm only a man with a chamber who's got me,
      Em             G        D             A
 I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
    Em          G
 A monster, A monster,
       D                A
 I've turned into a monster,
    Em          G
 A monster, A monster,
       D                A
 And it keeps getting stronger.

 I'm only a man with a chamber who's got me,
     Em           G           D             A
 I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
    Em          G
 A monster, A monster,
        D               A
 I've turned into a monster,
    Em          G
 A monster, A monster,
       D                    A
 And it keeps getting stronger.
