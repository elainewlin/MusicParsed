[Intro]

[Verse]
        D  G    Bm
Come along with me
     D    A          G
To a town beside the sea
       Bm                 G
We can wander through the forest
   D            A
And do so as we please

        D  G    Bm
Come along with me
     D       A      G
To a cliff under a tree
            Bm            G
Where we'll gaze upon the water
          A       D
As an everlasting dream

[Chorus]
F♯         G
All of my affections
Bm          A      D
I give them all to you
F♯            G
Maybe by next summer
D                         A
We won't have changed our tunes

[Verse]
             D    G  Bm
'Cause we'll want to be
        D      A        G
In this town beside the sea
Bm            G
Making up new numbers
           A    D
And living so merrily
        D  G    Bm
Come along with me
     D    A          G
And the butterflies and bees
       Bm                 G
We can wander through the forest
   D            A
And do so as we please

[Chorus]
F♯         G
All of my affections
Bm          A      D
I give them all to you
F♯                   G
I'll be here for you always
    D              A
And always be for you

[Verse]
        D  G    Bm
Come along with me
     D    A          G
To a town beside the sea
       Bm                 G
We can wander through the forest
    D     A     Bm
And do so as we please
G         A    D
Living so merrily
