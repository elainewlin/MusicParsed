[Verse 1]
F#m9        E5     Dmaj7     Bm
I failed to hold onto my idealistic view of you
F#m9             E5        Dmaj7             Bm
Cause the girl I thought I knew could not be further from the truth
F#m9           E5        Dmaj7             Bm
She knew right where she was and where she wanted be
F#m9        E5              Dmaj7           Bm
But who you are and who you seem are two completely different things
F#m

[Verse 2]
F#m9          E5     Dmaj7           Bm
She looked me in the eye and told me you were fine
F#m9         E5         Dmaj7      Bm
And though I questioned her she convinced me you were mine
F#m9       E5      Dmaj7         Bm
She had me in your hands helplessly oblivious
F#m9             E5          Dmaj7                Bm
To the fact that you weren't her; that there were really three of us
F#m

[Pre-Chorus]
D              A/C#
She was just a dream
             A
A dream that felt so right
          E/G#
A dream I held so tight
             D              A/C#
But then you woke me with a fright
             A                      E/G#                  B
And then the girl of my dreams disappeared into the night

[Chorus]
D       Bm9
You and me
      F#m11                   
Never were because of her 
               Esus2
And because of her
      E             D                
I can never hope to be
           Bm9
Completely sure
            E
That when I fell in love with you
       C#7                      F#m9  E5  Dmaj7
It was you and not an impostor
             Bm
Was she your impostor?
F#m9  E5  Dmaj7  Bm

[Verse 3]
Syncopated strum!
F#m             E  D                  C#7       F#m
By the time I recognized that she was you in disguise
                  E   D               C#7         F#m
My guard had been let down leaving my heart compromised
             E    D               C#7       F#m
I have played the fool and I have played it well
               E          D           C#7             F#m
I knew not who you really were as she cast her little spell
F#m

[Pre-Chorus]
D              A/C#
She was just a dream
             A
A dream that felt so right
          E/G#
A dream I held so tight
             D              A/C#
But then you woke me with a fright
             A                      E/G#                  B
And then the girl of my dreams disappeared into the night

[Chorus]

You and me
      F#m11                   
Never were because of her 
               Esus2
And because of her
      E             D                
I can never hope to be
           Bm9
Completely sure
            E

Was she an impostor?
             Bm
Was she your impostor?
