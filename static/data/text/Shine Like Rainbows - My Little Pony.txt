[Applejack]

C           F
Once upon a time
          Am                                 G
You came into my world and made the stars align


[Rarity]

C                 F
Now I can see the signs
            Am                             G
You pick me up when I get down so I can shine


[The Rainbooms]

            C       F
Shine like rainbows
           Am       G
Shine like rainbows 
            C       F
Shine like rainbows 
           Am       G
Shine like rainbows 


[Rainbow Dash]

C                     F
Friends, you are in my life
             Am                             G
And you can count on me to be there by your side


[Sunset Shimmer]

C                         F
And when the music comes alive
            Am                              G
We sing our songs to lift us up so we can shine


[The Rainbooms]

          Am                        F
And the sound that we hear in our hearts
            C     G
It's a crescendo
         Am                        F
And the light that ignites in the dark
                C    G
It makes us all glow
             
                C      F
And shine like rainbows
               Am     G
We shine like rainbows
             C      F
Shine like rainbows
              Am      G
We shine like rainbows

Dm           Bb 
Together we stand
        F              C
As the rain begins to fall
Dm                Bb 
And holding our heads up high
       F                     C
As the sun shines through it all

         Am                         F
And the sound that we hear in our hearts
            C     G
It's a crescendo 
         Am                         F
And the light that ignites in the dark
                C   G
It makes us all glow 

                C     F
And shine like rainbows
               Am     G
We shine like rainbows
             C     F
Shine like rainbows
               Am    G
We shine like rainbows
               C
We shine like rainbows
