Gm         Bb
Head under water
         Dm
and they tell me
            F
to breathe easy for a while
Gm                 Bb
But breathing gets harder
     Dm       F
even I know that
 
Gm                Bb
You made room for me
                    Dm
but it's too soon to see
       F
if I'm happy in your hands
Gm     Bb                 Dm     F
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Gm           F
blank stares at blank pages
Bb      C
no easy way to say this
Gm          F                    Bb
you mean well,  but you make this hard on me
 
 
[Chorus]
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
'cause you asked for it
            F            Bb
'cause you need one, you see
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
'cause you tell me it's
         F
make or break in this
        Bb
if you're on your way
               Gm           F
I'm not gonna write you to stay
   Dm                           G  
if all you have is leavin' Imma need a better reason
   Bb            C            Gm  Bb  Dm  F
to write you a love song today
 
 
[Verse 2]
Gm            Bb
I learned the hard way
          Dm
that they all say
F
things you wanna hear
Gm           Bb
and my heavy heart
      Dm        F
sings deep down under you
Gm               Bb
and your twisted words
               Dm
your help just hurts
         F                      Gm
you were not what I thought you were
Bb       Dm       F
Hello to high and dry
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Gm           F
convinced me to please you
Bb      C
made me think that I need this too
Gm          F                    Bb
i'm trying to let you hear me as i am
 
 
[Chorus]
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
'cause you asked for it
            F            Bb
'cause you need one, you see
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
'cause you tell me it's
         F
make or break in this
        Bb
if you're on your way
               Gm           F
I'm not gonna write you to stay
   Dm                           G  
if all you have is leavin' Imma need a better reason
   Bb            C            Gm  Bb  Dm  F
to write you a love song today
 
 
[Bridge]
Dm      Am      Bb
promise me
                 F     C
you'll leave the light on
Dm         Am      Bb
to help me see
                  F      C
with daylight, my guide, gone
Dm       A            Bb
'cause i believe there's a way
        C
you can love me because i say
 [Chorus]
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
'cause you asked for it
            F            Bb
'cause you need one, you see
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song

'cause you tell me it's
         F

        Bb
if you're on your way
               Gm           F
I'm not gonna write you to stay
        Dm
if your heart is nowhere in it
       C
I don't want it for a minute
         Dm
babe I'll walk the seven seas
         Gm  
when I believe that there's a reason
   Bb          C         Gm  Bb  Dm  F
to write you a love song today, today
