[Verse]

F                                          C F
It's time to bid this whole world goodbye.
                      F      C
Oh, glory, time to fly away.
               F                  Bb
We'll meet our Savior in the sky.
     Dm        Am  C    F
Hallelujah, the 21st of May.


[Verse]

F                                 C F
Sinner, heed these words of mine
                               C
'Bout the coming Judgment Day.
         F                    Bb
Yes, the end is drawing nigh.
     Dm        Am  C    F
Hallelujah, the 21st of May.


[Chorus]

     Gm                                 F
They laughed while Noah built his boat,
     Dm                        C
Then cried when came the rain.
     Gm                             F
They mock me now, but I will float
      Dm Am    C
On the 21st of May.


[Verse]

           F                   C F
Well, I've never been so sure
                           C
And I've never led no one astray.
             F         Bb
'Cept in the fall of '94.
         Dm        Am  C    F
But Hallelujah, the 21st of May.


[Chorus]

     Gm                 F
They laughed while Noah built his boat,
     Dm                  C
Then cried when came the rain.
     Gm               F
They mock me now, but I will float
      Dm Am     C
On the 21st of May.
     Gm               F
They mock me now, but I will float
       Dm C    F
On the 21st of May.
