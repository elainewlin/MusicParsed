[Verse]

G            Em
I -  found - God
       D                     C
On the corner of First and Amistad
G             Em
Where the    west
    D         C
Was all but won
G            Em
All   a   -  lone
    D            C
Smoking his last cigarette
         G             Em
I said, "Where  you   been?"
          D          C
He said, "Ask anything."


[Verse 2]

G            Em
Where were   you
D                     C
When everything was falling apart?
G            Em
All   my    days
D                   C
Were spent by the telephone
G            Em
That  never  rang
D                  C
And all I needed was a call
G           Em
It   never  came
D                            C
To the corner of First and Amistad


[Chorus]

Em          C
Lost and insecure
G             D
You found me, you found me
Em             C
Lying on the floor
G          D
Surrounded, surrounded
Em               C
Why'd you have to wait?
G              D
Where were you, where were you?
Em             C
Just a little late
G             D
You found me, You found me




[Verse 3]

G           Em
In  - the - end
D               C
Everyone ends up alone
G           Em
Los---ing   her
D                    C
The only one who's ever known
G            Em
Who - I  -   am
        D             C
Who I'm not, and who I want to be
G             Em
No    way to know
D                    Cadd9
How long she will be next to me


[Chorus]

Em          C
Lost and insecure
G             D
You found me, you found me
Em             C
Lying on the floor
G          D
Surrounded, surrounded
Em               C
Why'd you have to wait?
G              D
Where were you, where were you?
Em             C
Just a little late
G             D
You found me, You found me


[Bridge]

         Cadd9
Early morning
         Dsus2
The city breaks
          Cadd9
I've been calling
                        Dsus2
For years and years and years and years
                           Cadd9
And you never left me no messages
                        Dsus2
You never sent me no letters
                       Cadd9
You got some kind of nerve
              Dsus2
Taking all I want


[Chorus]

Em       C
Lost and insecure
G            D
You found me, you found me
Em          C
Lying on the floor
G              D
Where were you where were you


[Chorus]

Em       C
Lost and insecure
G             D
You found me, you found me
Em           C
Lying on the floor
G           D
Surrounded, surrounded
Em             C
Why'd you have to wait?
G               D
Where were you? Where were you?
Em            C
Just a little late
G             D
You found me, you found me

Em              C
Why'd you have to wait?
G           D              Em
To find me, to find meeeee
