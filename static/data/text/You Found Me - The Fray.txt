[Verse 1]
 
E B     G#m
I found god
       F#        B              E       
On the corner of first and Amistad
E     B   G#m      F#  B   E
Where the west was all but won
E   B  G#m F#         B    E
All alone smoking his last cigarette
       E     B   G#m           F#  B  E
I Said where you been, he said ask anything
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G#m    F#  E
Where were you?
     F#         B           E
When everything was falling apart
G#m F#  E        F#    B      E
All my days were spent by the telephone
   F#  B E
It never rang
    F#    B      E
And all I needed was a call
     F# B  E
That never came
       G#m       F#        E      F#  B
To the corner of first and Amistad
 
[Chorus]
G#m      E
Lost and insecure
B             F#
You found me, you found me
G#m          E
Lying on the floor
B           F#
Surrounded, surrounded
G#m               E
Why’d you have to wait?
B               F#
Where were you? Where were you?
G#m           E
Just a little late
B             F#  B     E
You found me, you found me
 
[Verse 2]
G#m F# E   F#     B      E   
In the end everyone ends up alone
G#m F# E    F#    B      E 
Losing her, the only one who’s ever known
B   E G#m         F#                 E
Who I am, who I’m not, who I want to be 
   B   F# E        F#            B          E
No way to know how long she will be next to me
 
[Chorus]
G#m      E
Lost and insecure
B             F#
You found me, you found me
G#m          E
Lying on the floor
B           F#
Surrounded, surrounded
G#m               E
Why’d you have to wait?
B               F#
Where were you? Where were you?
G#m           E
Just a little late
B             F#  B     E
You found me, you found me
 
[Bridge]
F#  B E        F# B E 
Early morning, City breaks      
F#   B    E           F#   B    E         F#   B    E
I’ve been calling for years and years and years and years
        F#    B    E
And you never left me no messages
          F#   B     E
You never send me no letters
                     F#            B     E
You got some kind of nerve, taking all I want
 
[Chorus]
G#m      E
Lost and insecure
B             F#
You found me, you found me
G#m          E
Lying on the floor
B              F#
Where were you where were you

G#m      E
Lost and insecure
B             F#
You found me, you found me
G#m          E
Lying on the floor
B           F#
Surrounded, surrounded
G#m       E
Why’d you have to wait?
B               F#
Where were you? Where were you?
G#m           E
Just a little late
B             F#  B     E
You found me, you found me
G#m       E
Why’d you have to wait?
B           F#     B    E
To find me, to find me
