[Verse]

C         F                  Am         G
  Shadows settle on the place  that you left.
C               F               Am       G
  Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
C             F              Am          G
  Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time.

From the perfect start to the finish line.

       C              F                  Am         G
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs.
        C           F           Am         G
Setting fire to our insides for fun
           C            F                     Am
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
    G
The lovers that went wrong.

[Verse]

C            F                    Am         G
  We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
        C          F              Am         G
Chasing visions of our futures
    C         F          Am            G
One day we'll reveal the truth
              C             F           Am   G
That one will die before he gets there.


[Chorus]

       C            F                    Am         G
And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones.
       C           F                  Am                     G
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone.
               C          F           Am    G
We're setting fire to our insides for fun.
           C                 F                      Am
Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home,
         G
It was a flood that wrecked this home.

[Verse]

C                 F               Am         G
Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silouhette,
  C        F                     Am          G
A lifeless face that you'll soon forget,
   C        F             Am                 G
My eyes are damp from the words you left,
        C     F              Am              G
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
        C     F              Am              G
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.


[Chorus]
       C          F                     Am        G
And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one,
       C              F           Am          G
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
        C           F           Am     G
Setting fire to our insides for fun
   C                        F            Am
To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
        G
But I'm forever missing him.
