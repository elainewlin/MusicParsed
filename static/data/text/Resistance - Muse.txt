[Intro] Am G F E x2

               Am
Is your secret safe tonight?
           G
And are we out of sight?
            F                   E
Or will our world come tumbling down?

                   Am
Will they find our hiding place?
            G
Is this our last embrace?
            F
Or will the walls start caving in?


[Bridge]

F                                                         Am
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should've been right
                                                   G
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Let our hearts ignite
                                                     F
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole?

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is outta control
                                                   Am
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last
                                                     G
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Left to raise it fast
                                                         F
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could've been right

(It could be wrong, could be)


[Chorus]

              C
Love is our resistance
                                                   G
They keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
    Am                     Am/G      F       E
And hold me, our lips must always be sealed

Am G F E

               Am
If we live our life in fear
            G
I'll wait a thousand years
        F              E
Just to see you smile again

                       Am
Quell your prayers for love and peace
                G
You'll wake the thought police
       F
We can hide the truth inside

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Let our hearts ignite
                                                     F

              C
The night has reached its end
         G
We can't pretend
        F Am G
We must run
        F Am G
We must run
             F Am G E F
It's time to run

A           Dm
Take us away from here
   A              Dm         C    
Protect us from further harm
  G  A5    B5 C5 D5 F5
Resistance!

Am G F E x2
