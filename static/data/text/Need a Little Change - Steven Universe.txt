C                           Am 
You, Look at everything you are

                       Em
Look at everything you do

                      F              
It's incredible, as incredible as you

    C                          Am
And me, I guess I'm content to be

                      Em           F              
On the arm of someone who, is as incredible as you

           Dm              G     
And it's a full-time job admiring

        C         Em       Am     
All the ways that you're inspiring

     Dm                           
If I had my way, I'd do it all day

                G                        
That's why it's really really hard to say

                        C     Cmaj7  Am  
I think I need a little chaaa-aaaaaa-ange

                        C     Cmaj7  Am  
I think I need a little chaaa-aaaaaa-ange

                        C     Cmaj7  Am  Em  F   G   C   
I think I need a little Chaaa-aaaaaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-ange

E7                      
Oh, I always did believe

                     Am  
That love is all you need

To be a happy man

E7                          
Oh, That may have been naive

                  Am 
I guess I need to eat

                   F   
That wasn't in the plan

           Dm7             G     
And it's a full-time job admiring

        C         Em       Am     
All the ways that you're inspiring

     Dm                           
If I had my way, I'd do it all day

         G                        
The only problem is it doesn't pay

                        C     Cmaj7  Am  
I think I need a little chaaa-aaaaaa-ange

                        C     Cmaj7  Am  
I think I need a little chaaa-aaaaaa-ange

                        C     Cmaj7  Am  Em  F   G   C   
I think I need a little Chaaa-aaaaaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-ange
