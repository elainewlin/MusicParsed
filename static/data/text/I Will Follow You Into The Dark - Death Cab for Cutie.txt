Dm                    F
Love of mine, someday you will die,
             A#
but i'll be close behind,
            F             C
I'll follow you into the dark,
Dm                             F
blinding lights, or tunnels to gates of white,
                 A#
just our hands clasped so tight
        F                  C
waiting for the hint of a spark
Dm                  F                A#             F   C
If Heaven and hell decide, that they both are satisfied,
  Dm            F               C/G
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
    Dm             F                   A       F    C
if theyr's noone beside you, when your soul embarks,
      A#             A#m     F
then ill follow you into the dark
Dm                                F
In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
          A#                    F      C
I got my knuckles brusied by a lady in black
      Dm                      F
And I held my toungue as she told me
                  A#
"Son fear is the heart of love"
      F          C
So I never went back
Dm                  F
If heaven and hell decide
          A#            F    C
That they both are satisfied
Dm             F              C/G
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
Dm                 F
If there's no one beside you
           A       F   C
When your soul embarks
      A#             Bm       F
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Dm                    F
You and me have seen everything to see
              A#
From Bangkok to Calgary
         F              C          Dm
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
              F
The time for sleep is now
               A#
It's nothing to cry about
            F             C
Cause we'll hold each other soon
   Dm           F  A# F C
The blackest of rooms
Dm                 F
If heaven and hell decide
           A#            F   C
That they both are satisfied
Dm             A#                C/G
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
Dm                  F
If there's no one beside you
          A       F   C
When your soul embarks
      A#             A#m        F
Then I'll follow you into the dark
      A#              A#m        F
Then I'll follow you into the dark
