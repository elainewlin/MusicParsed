[Verse]
Dm                    F
Love of mine, someday you will die,
             Bb
but I'll be close behind,
            F             C
I'll follow you into the dark.

Dm                                F
No blinding lights, or tunnels to gates of white,
               Bb
just our hands clasped so tight
        F                  C
waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus]
Dm                  F                Bb             F   C
If Heaven and hell decide, that they both are satisfied,
  Dm            F               C/G
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
    Dm             F                   A       F    C
if there's no one beside you, when your soul embarks,
      Bb             Bbm     F
then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse]
Dm                                F
In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
          Bb                    F      C
I got my knuckles brusied by a lady in black
      Dm                      F
And I held my tongue as she told me
                  Bb
"Son, fear is the heart of love"
      F          C
So I never went back

[Chorus]
Dm                  F                Bb             F   C
If Heaven and hell decide, that they both are satisfied,
  Dm            F               C/G
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
    Dm             F                   A       F    C
if there's no one beside you, when your soul embarks,
      Bb             Bbm     F
then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse]
Dm                    F
You and me have seen everything to see
              Bb
From Bangkok to Calgary
         F              C          Dm
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
              F
The time for sleep is now
               Bb
It's nothing to cry about
            F             C
Cause we'll hold each other soon
   Dm           F  Bb F C
The blackest of rooms

[Chorus]
Dm                  F                Bb             F   C
If Heaven and hell decide, that they both are satisfied,
  Dm            F               C/G
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
    Dm             F                   A       F    C
if there's no one beside you, when your soul embarks,
      Bb             Bbm     F
then I'll follow you into the dark
      Bb             Bbm     F
Then I'll follow you into the dark
