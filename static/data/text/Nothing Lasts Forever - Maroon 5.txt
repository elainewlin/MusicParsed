[Intro]

D Dmaj7 G G

[Verse 1]

D
It is so easy to see
   Dmaj7
Dysfunction between you and me
   G
We must free up these tired souls
  G
Before the sadness gets us both

  D
I tried and tried to let you know
   Dmaj7
I love you but I'm letting go
   G
It may not last but I don't know
G
Just don't know

       D
If you don't know, then you can't care
      Dmaj7
And I show up, but you're not there
        G
But I'm waiting, and you want to
       G
Still afraid that I will desert you


[Chorus]

D
Everyday
     Dmaj7                            D
With every worthless word we get more far away
    Dmaj7                           G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
    G                            Gm
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
                                D
It hurts but it may be the only way


[Verse]

  D
A bed that's warm with memories
    Dmaj7
Can heal us temporarily
    G
But misbehaving only makes
    G
The ditch between us so damn deep

D
Built a wall around my heart
Dmaj7
Never let it fall apart
G
Strangely I wish secretly
   G
It would fall down while I'm asleep

       D
If you don't know, then you can't care
      Dmaj7
And I show up, but you're not there
        G
But I'm waiting, and you want to
       G
Still afraid that I will desert you

[Chorus]

D
Everyday
     Dmaj7                            D
With every worthless word we get more far away
    Dmaj7                           G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
    G                            Gm
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way


[Bridge]

Em
 Though we have not hit the ground
G                             D        Bm
 Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
  Em
I want so bad to pick you up
    G                               D
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
       Bm                                 A
What a shame I hope you find somewhere to place the blame

But until then the fact remains


[Chorus]

D
Everyday
     Dmaj7                            D
With every worthless word we get more far away
    Dmaj7                           G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
    G                            Gm
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
                                D
It hurts but it may be the only way

D
Everyday
     Dmaj7                            D
With every worthless word we get more far away
    Dmaj7                           G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
    G                            Gm
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
                                D
It hurts but it may be the only way
