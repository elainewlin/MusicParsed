[Intro]

D Dmaj7 G

[Verse 1]

D
It is so easy to see
Dmaj7
Dysfunction between you and me
G
We must free up these tired souls
G
Before the sadness gets us both

D
I tried and tried to let you know
Dmaj7
I love you but I'm letting go
G
It may not last but I don't know
G
Just don't know

D
If you don't know, then you can't care
Dmaj7
And I show up, but you're not there
G
But I'm waiting, and you want to
Gm
Still afraid that I will desert you


[Chorus]

D
Everyday
Dmaj7                                 D
With every word whispered we get more far away
Dmaj7                               G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
G
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
Gm                                 D
It hurts but it may be the only way


[Verse]

(Same as 1st Verse)

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving all he makes
The ditch between us so damn deep

Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It won't fall down while I'm asleep

If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting, and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe


[Chorus]

D
Everyday
Dmaj7                                 D
With every word whispered we get more far away
Dmaj7                               G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
G
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
Gm                                 D
It hurts but it may be the only way


[Bridge]

Em
But we have not hit the ground
G                             D        Bm
Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
Em
I want so bad to pick you up
G                                 D
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
        Bm                                     A
What a shame I hope you find somewhere to place the blame

But until then the fact remains


[Chorus]

D
Everyday
Dmaj7                                 D
With every word whispered we get more far away
Dmaj7                               G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
G
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
Gm                                 D
It hurts but it may be the only way

D
Everyday
Dmaj7                                 D
With every word whispered we get more far away
Dmaj7                               G
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
G
But nothing last forever, but be honest babe
Gm                                 D
It hurts but it may be the only way
