[Verse 1]
Am                              F
Tell me what you want, what you like, it's okay
C                    G
I'm a little curious too, 
Am                             F
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care
C                         G
I can keep a secret could, you?


[Pre-Chorus]
       Am                          F
Got my mind on your body, and your body on my mind
      C                                          G
Got a taste for the cherry I just need to take a bite
Am                       F
Don't tell your mother, kiss one another
C                      G
Die for each other, we're cool for the summer
Am   F   C   G
Oooh


[Chorus]
Am             F
   Take me down into your paradise
C                  G
   Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
Am         F
   Just something that we wanna try
C                G
Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer


[Verse 2]
Am                     F 
Tell me if I won, if I did, what's my prize?
C                           G
I just wanna play with you, too
Am                          F
Even if they judge, fuck it all, do the time
C                          G
I just wanna have some fun with you


[Pre-Chorus]
       Am                          F
Got my mind on your body, and your body on my mind
