[Intro]

Em C G D


[Verse]

     Em                     C
On the first page of our story
     G                D
The future seemed so bright
      Em                      G
Then this thing turned out so evil
   G                         D
I don't know why i'm still surprised

     Em                 C
Even angels have their wicked schemes
       G                   D
And you take that to new extremes
            Em           C
But you'll always be my hero
      G                       D
Even though you've lost your mind


[Chorus]

            Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
            G                               D
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
            Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
   G                                        D
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
     Em             G
I love the way you lie
     C              D
I love the way you lie


[Verse]

     Em                 C
Now there's gravel in our voices
     G                D
Glasses shattered from the fight
      Em                      G
In this tug of war you always win
   G                         D
Even when i'm right

     Em                 C
Cause you feed me fables from your head
     G                D
With violent words and empty threats
      Em                      G
And it's sick that all these battles
   G                         D
are what keeps me satisfied


[Chorus]

            Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
            G                               D
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
            Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
   G                                        D
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
     Em             G
I love the way you lie
     C              D
I love the way you lie


[Bridge]


Em                 C
So maybe i'm a masochist
G                D
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
 Em                 C
Till the walls are going up
G                    D    C
In smoke with all our memories


[Chorus]

           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
            G                               D
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
            Em                     C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
            G                                  D
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
                   Em                C
I love the way you lie
                   G                 D
I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie
