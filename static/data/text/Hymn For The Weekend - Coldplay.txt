Dm G Am Am


[Verse]

                Dm       G    Am
Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above
              Dm        G        Am
You know you make my world light up
                Dm
When I was down
     G       Am
When I was hurt
             Dm      Am
You came to lift me up...

            Dm         G        Am
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
           Dm             G     Am
Oh now I think I must be miles up
             Dm       G          Am
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
             Dm       Am
You came to rain a flood


[Pre-Chorus]

              Am             F
So drink from me, drink from me
            Dm
When I was so thirsty
             Am
Pour on a symphony
     G
Now I just can't get enough

                Am             F
Put your wings on me, wings on me
           G
When I was so heavy
          Am
Pour on a symphony
        G
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low


[Chorus]

 F    G   Am
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G       Am
So high, so high
 F    G   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G        Am
So high, so high

Dm G Am


[Verse]

                Dm       G    Am
Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above
              Dm        G        Am
I feel you coursing through my blood
            Dm         G        Am
Life is a drink, your love's about
                Dm        Am
To make the stars come out


[Pre-Chorus]

                Am             F
Put your wings on me, wings on me
           G
When I was so heavy
          Am
Pour on a symphony
        G
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low


[Chorus]

 F    G   Am
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G       Am
So high, so high
 F    G   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G        Am
So high, so high

 F    Dm   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
              F         G       Am
la-la-la-la-la-la high so high so high

 F    G   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G        Am
So high, so high


[Outro]

                                F G Am
Then we'll shoot across the sky
                           F G Am
Then we'll shoot across the ...
                           F G Am
Then we'll shoot across the sky
                           F G Am
Then we'll shoot across the ...

                               F G Am
Then we'll shoot across the sky
                               F G Am
Then we'll shoot across the...
                            
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
