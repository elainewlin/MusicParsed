[Verse]

A              E
I’ve given up on giving up slowly,
D
I’m blending in so you won’t even know me
A           E                     F#m    E   D
apart from this whole world that shares my fate
A               E               D
This one last bullet you mention is my one last shot at redemption
A                  E                       F#m  E  D
because I know to live you must give your life away


[Pre-Chorus]

                F#m               D        A       E
And I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity
           F#m                  D             A                 E
I’ve been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
               F#m           D                 A               E
And I’ve been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
            D
And even though, there’s no way in knowing where to go,
              E
promise I’m going because


[Chorus]

A    E             D       E
I---I gotta get outta here
      A                E               D          E
I’m stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
A    E             D       E
I---I gotta get outta here
         F#m                E
And I’m begging You, I’m begging You,
       D           E        A
I’m begging You to be my escape.


[Verse]

A                  E
I’m giving up on doing this alone now
D
Cause I’ve failed and I’m ready to be shown how
A                 E                 F#m  E    D
He’s told me the way and I’m trying to get there
A                E
And this life sentence that I’m serving
D
I admit that I’m every bit deserving
A                   E                     F#m   E   D
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair


[Pre-Chorus]

                F#m               D        A       E
And I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity
           F#m                  D             A                 E
I’ve been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
               F#m           D                 A               E
And I’ve been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
            D
And even though, there’s no way in knowing where to go,
              E
promise I’m going because


[Chorus]

 A    E             D       E
I---I gotta get outta here
       A                  E          D                 E
I'm afraid that this complacency is something I can't shake
A    E             D       E
I---I gotta get outta here
         F#m                 E
And I’m begging You, I’m begging You,
       D           E        A
I’m begging You to be my escape.


[Bridge]

F#m        E   D       E
I am a hostage to my own humanity
F#m       E                   D            E
Self detained and forced to live in this mess I’ve made
F#m            E           D          E
And all I’m asking is for You to do what You can with me
F#m                       D                     E
But I can’t ask You to give what You already gave


[Pre-Chorus]

                F#m               D        A       E
And I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity
           F#m                  D             A                 E
I’ve been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
               F#m           D                 A               E
And I’ve been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
            D
And even though, there’s no way in knowing where to go,
              E
promise I’m going because


[Chorus]

A    E             D       E
I---I gotta get outta here
      A                E               D          E
I’m stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
A    E             D       E
I---I gotta get outta here
         F#m                E
And I’m begging You, I’m begging You,
       D           E        A
I’m begging You to be my escape.
