Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
F♯m
 You have my eyes
    Dmaj7
You have your mother's name
E        A                       C♯m/G♯
When you came into the world you cried
                F♯m
And it broke my heart
Dmaj7  E
        
A                  C♯m/G♯
I'm dedicating every day to you
F♯m                Dmaj7
 Domestic life was never quite my style
E        A
When you smile
C♯m/G♯                    F♯m
 You knock me out, I fall apart
                       Dmaj7
And I thought I was so smart
E        A                          C♯m/G♯
You will come of age with our young nation
                F♯m
We'll bleed and fight for you
              Dmaj7
We'll make it right for you
E     A                      C♯m/G♯
If we lay a strong enough foundation
              F♯m
We'll pass it on to you
               Dmaj7
We'll give the world to you
                   E    A
And you'll blow us all away
   C♯m/G♯    F♯m  Dmaj7
Someday, someday      
                     E    A
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
   C♯m/G♯    F♯m  Dmaj7 E
Someday, someday

Ooh, Phillip when you smile I am undone

My son
           A
Look at my son
C♯m/G♯                            F♯m
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
                 Esus4         E
There is so much more inside me now
A    C♯m/G♯                        F♯m
Ooh, Phillip you outshine the morning sun
  Esus4  E
My son    
         A      C♯m/G♯
When you smile        
        F♯m
I fall apart
                      Esus4  E
And I thought I was so smart

My father wasn't around (My father wasn't around)
