                               A                  Bm
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
G                     D      A                        D
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off off my chair
               D      A                    Bm
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
    G             D     A          D
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand
                   D      A              Bm

                        D          A                  Bm
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
G                    D        A             D
  But I can turn 'em inside out, I don't need no help
              D     A                Bm
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
G                D             A            D
  There ain't no curves like hers in them downtown streets

Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
   G         D          A         D
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

Verse 3:
                      D        A                        Bm
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
G                 D       A             D
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
               D       A                  Bm
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile
   G                 D       A           D
We get there when we get there, every inch is a mile


Chorus 3:

I know every curve like the back of my hand
                   D      A              Bm
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
   G         D          A         D

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
