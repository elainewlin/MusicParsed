Dm            C                  Gm              Dm
I can see how you are beautiful, can you feel my eyes on you,
Dm              C                Gm                 Dm
Working late in diner Citylight, I see that you get home alright
A#             C                 A#              C
Make sure that you can't see me, hoping you will see me
A             Dm                A#
Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
C            Dm             A#
You can't be acting like my Dana (can you)
C            Dm              A#                Gm
I see you in Citylight diner serving all those meals and then
C                 Dm            A#    C
I see reflections of me in your eyes, oh please
A#        C     A          Dm
You touch me in many, many ways
A#          C         Dm
But I'm shy can't you see
Dm                    C                    Gm              Dm
Obsessed by you, your looks, well, anyway "I would any day die for you",
Dm             C                Gm                 Dm
Still I sit in diner Citylight, drinking coffee or reading lies
A#               C              A#                C
Turn my head and I can see you, could that really be you
A             Dm                A#
Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
C            Dm             A#
You can't be acting like my Dana (can you)
C          Dm                  A#              Gm
I see your beautiful smile and I would like to run away from
C           Dm            A#    C
Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please
A#        C     A          Dm
You touch me in many, many ways
A#          C         Dm
But I'm shy can't you see
Gm  A    A#                              C
I see, can't have you, can't leave you there 'cos I must sometimes see you
A#                     C           Gm
And I don't understand how you can keep me in chains
A#                     C                       A#
And every waking hour, I feel you taking power from me and I can't leave
C             Gm      A
Repeating the scenery over again
A             Dm                A#
Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
C            Dm             A#
You can't be acting like my Dana (can you)
C          Dm                  A#              Gm
I see your beautiful smile and I would like to run away from
C           Dm            A#    C
Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please
A#        C     A          Dm
You touch me in many, many ways
A#          C         Dm
But I'm shy can't you see
         A#   C  Dm  A#   C    Dm
Oh baby, Talk to me, show some pity
A#        C     A          Dm
You touch me in many, many ways
