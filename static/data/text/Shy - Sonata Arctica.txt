[Verse]
Am            G                Dm                Am
I can see how you are beautiful, can you feel my eyes on you,
F           G             Am
I'm shy and turn my head away
Am              G              Dm                    Am
Working late in diner Citylight, I see that you get home alright
F              G                 F               G
Make sure that you can't see me, hoping you will see me

[Pre-Chorus]
E              Am                F                Dm
Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
G            Am             F
You can't be acting like my Dana (can you?)
G            Am              F                 Dm
I see you in Citylight diner serving all those meals and then
  G               Am         F       G
I see reflections of me in your eye, oh please

[Chorus]
F    G  Am  F    G    Am
Talk to me, show some pity
F         G     E          Am       F        G         Am
You touch me in many, many ways but I'm shy can't you see

[Verse]
Am                G                       Dm               Am
Obsessed by you, your looks, well, anyway "I would any day die for you",
F          G            Am
I write on paper erased away
Am              G                Dm                   Am
Still I sit in diner Citylight, drinking coffee or reading lies
F                G               F                G
Turn my head and I can see you, could that really be you

[Pre-Chorus]
E              Am                F                Dm
Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
G            Am             F
You can't be acting like my Dana?
G           Am                 F                Dm
I see your beautiful smile and I would like to run away from
  G            Am          F       G
Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please

[Chorus]
F    G  Am  F    G    Am
Talk to me, show some pity
F         G     E          Am       F        G         Am
You touch me in many, many ways but I'm shy can't you see

[Bridge]
G A  Dm               A#                 C
I see, can't have you, can't leave you, there 'cause I must sometimes see you
Dm          A#          G           C            Dm
And I don't understand how you can keep me in chains
Dm        A#           C
And every waking hour, I feel you taking power
Dm          A#                 G            C     A    F
From me and I can't leave, repeating the scenery over again

[Instrumental]
F G Am F G Am
F G E Am F G Am

[Pre-Chorus]
E              Am                F                Dm
Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
G            Am             F
You can't be acting like my Dana?
G           Am                 F                Dm
I see your beautiful smile and I would like to run away from
  G            Am          F       G
Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please

[Chorus]
F    G  Am  F    G    Am
Talk to me, show some pity
F         G     E          Am       F        G         Am
You touch me in many, many ways but I'm shy can't you see, Oh baby

F    G  Am  F    G    Am
Talk to me, show some pity
F         G     E          Am  
You touch me in many, many ways
    F        G         F        G         F        G         Am
But I'm shy can't you, I'm shy can't you, I'm shy can't you see
