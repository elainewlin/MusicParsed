[Verse]

C      Am      F    G
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
C       Am           F       G
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
Am                       F
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
C                             G
And she's got everything that I have to live without

C     Am       F    G
Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's so damn funny
C       Am         F   G
That I can't even see, anyone when he's with me
Am                       F
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
C                         G
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


[Chorus]

C                      G
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Am                           F
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
C                    G                              Am      F
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do


[Verse]

C    Am        F   G
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
C            Am             F
And there he goes so perfectly
            G
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Am                          F
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
C                             G
Look in those beautiful eyes, and know she lucky cause


[Chorus]

C                      G
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Am                           F
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
C                    G                              Am      F
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do


[Bridge]

Am                    F
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
C                         G
I put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

C                             G
Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Am                      F
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart


[Chorus]

C                    G                              Am      F
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
C                     G
He's the time, taken up, but there's never enough
Am                        F
He's all I need to fall into

C    Am        F     G                        C
Drew talks to me, I fake a smile so he won't see
