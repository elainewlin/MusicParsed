        C  F    Am
Come along with me
     C    G          F
To a town beside the sea
       Am                 F
We can wander through the forest
   C            G
And do so as we please

        C  F    Am
Come along with me
     C       G      F
To a cliff under a tree
            Am            F
Where we'll gaze upon the water
          G       C
As an everlasting dream

E         F
All of my affections
Am          G      C
I give them all to you
E            F
Maybe by next summer
C                         G
We won't have changed our tunes

             C    F  Am
'Cause we'll want to be
        C      G        F
In this town beside the sea
Am            F
Making up new numbers
           G    C
And living so merrily

        C  F    Am
Come along with me
     C    G          F
And the butterflies and bees
       Am                 F
We can wander through the forest
   C            G
And do so as we please

E         F
All of my affections
Am          G      C
I give them all to you
E                   F
I'll be here for you always
    C              G
And always be for you

        C  F    Am
Come along with me
     C    G          F
To a town beside the sea
       Am                 F
We can wander through the forest
    C     G     Am
And do so as we please
F         G    C
Living so merrily
