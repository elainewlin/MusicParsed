[Verse]

G                       Cadd9             Dsus4
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
G                            Cadd9              Dsus4
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
Em           D           C                   G
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
Em         D               C                 G
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time


[Chorus]

Em                  G         Em                  G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.
Em                 D            G
I hope you had the time of your life.




[Verse]

G                         Cadd9                  Dsus4
So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
G                  Cadd9                 Dsus4
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Em          D           C            G
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
Em            D           C            G
For what it's worth it was worth all the while


[Chorus]

Em                  G         Em                  G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.
Em                 D            G
I hope you had the time of your life.


[Chorus]

Em                   G        Em                  G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.
Em                 D            G
I hope you had the time of your life.
