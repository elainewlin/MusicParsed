[Verse 1]
G                       C                 D
Another turning point a fork stuck in the road,
G                                C                   D  
Time grabs you by the wrist, and directs you where to go
Em          D            C                 G
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
Em         D              C                 G
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time

[Chorus]
Em                    G           Em           G             
Its something unpredictable but in the end it's right
Em                 D            G 
I hope you had the time of your life.

[Verse 2]
G                             C                    D
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
G                         C                    D
Hang it on a shelf and in good health and good time
Em          D             C            G
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
Em            D            C             G    
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

[Chorus]
Em                    G           Em           G             
Its something unpredictable but in the end it's right
Em                 D            G
I hope you had the time of your life.

I hope you had the time of your life.
