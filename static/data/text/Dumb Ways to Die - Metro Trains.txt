Dumb ways to die

So many dumb ways to die

Get your toast out with a fork
Do your own electrical work
Teach yourself how to fly
Eat a two week old unrefrigerated pie

Invite a psycho killer inside
Scratch a drug dealer's brand new ride
Take your helmet off in outer space
Use a clothes dryer as a hiding place

Sell both your kidneys on the internet
Eat a tube of superglue

F        G      C           Fmaj7      F      G
Dress up like a moose during hunting season
   F        G        C      Fmaj7      F
Disturb a nest of wasps for no good reason
G                      Am
Stand on the edge of a train station platform
G                                Am
Drive around the boom gates at a level crossing
G                                 Am        G
Run across the tracks between the platforms
F                           G
They may not rhyme but they quite possibly

So many dumb ways to die
