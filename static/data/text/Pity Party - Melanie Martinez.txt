[Verse 1]

 Em                  G          C
Did my invitations disappear, why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter
 Em                     G             C
Tell me why the hell no one is here, tell me what to do to make it all feel better


[Pre-Chorus 1]

Em    G                     C
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me, whatever, whatever
Em           G                        C
Just means there's way more cake for me, forever, forever


[Chorus 1]

Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to
                    Em                 G                            C
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place, I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry, cry
                    Em                 G                            C
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place, I'll cry until my pity party's in flames


[Verse 2]

 Em                 G                C
Maybe if I knew all of them well, I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
 Em                G               C
Maybe if I casted out a spell, or told them decorations were in pastel ribbons


[Pre-Chorus 2]

Em    G                     C
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me, whatever, whatever
Em           G                        C
Just means there's way more cake for me, forever, forever


[Chorus 2]

Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry, cry
                    Em                 G                            C
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place, I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry, cry
                    Em                 G                            C
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place, I'll cry until my pity party's in flames


[Bridge]

Em     G                                  C
I'm crying, it feels like I'm dying, I'm laughing, I'm crying, it feels like I'm dying
     Em              G                            C
I'm laughing, I'm crying, it feels like I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying
Em            G                        C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to 
Em            G                        C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to


[Chorus 3]

Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry, cry
                    Em                 G                            C
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place, I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry, cry
                    Em                 G                            C
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place, I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Em             G                          C
It's my party, it's, it's my party, it's, it's my party, it's, it's my party, it's
Em            G                            C
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry, and cry, and cry
