[Verse 1]
Am   F    C      G
Each day, I'm so grateful
Am        F          C     G
I've been given more time
Am   F      C       G
Dark clouds come my way but
Am    F           C     G
I can see the sun shine

[Chorus]
     C      G     Am            F
So I smile, smile every day and night
C      G     Am             F
Smile, smile things will be alright
C          G        Am         F
Hard times come and hard times go
C      G     Am       F
Smile, smile joy will show

[Verse 2]
Am F      C           G
If you're filled with worry
Am        F       C    G
You don't have to fear
Am     F      C           G
You're brave, strong, and able
Am         F        C     G
There's no need for tears

[Chorus]
   C      G     Am            F
So smile, smile every day and night
C      G     Am             F
Smile, smile things will be alright
C          G        Am         F
Hard times come and hard times go
C      G     Am       F
Smile, smile joy will show

[Bridge]
F      G    C    Am
We can be a light
F       G     C      Am
Shining oh so bright

[Chorus]
        C      G     Am            F
When we smile, smile every day and night
C      G     Am             F
Smile, smile things will be alright
C          G        Am         F
Hard times come and hard times go
C      G     Am       F
Smile, smile joy will show
