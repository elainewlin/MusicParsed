[Verse 1]

       G                     C
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,
     G                C
I'm standing here outside your door,
   G               C             D
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye.
         G                      C
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,
     G                     C
The taxi's waitin', he's blowing his horn,
  G             C                D
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry.


[Chorus]

    G           C
So kiss me and smile for me,
G                   C
Tell me that you'll wait for me, 
G                   C            D
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
            G      C 
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, 
G               C
Don't know when I'll be back again,
G    C             D
Oh, babe, I hate to go.


[Verse 2]

           G               C
There's so many times I've let you down,
    G            C
So many times I played around,
   G         C               D
I tell you they don't mean a thing.
       G               C
Every place I go I'll think of you,
       G                C
Every song I sing I'll sing for you, 
     G                 C                 D
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.


[Chorus]

    G           C
So kiss me and smile for me,
G                   C
Tell me that you'll wait for me, 
G                   C            D
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
            G      C 
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, 
G               C
Don't know when I'll be back again,
G    C             D
Oh, babe, I hate to go.


[Verse 3]

G                 C
Now the time has come to leave you,
G              C
One more time let me kiss you,
     G                C             D
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
G                C
Dream about the days to come,
     G                C
When I won't have to leave alone,
 G              C                D
About the times I won't have to say


[Chorus]

    G           C
So kiss me and smile for me,
G                   C
Tell me that you'll wait for me, 
G                   C            D
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
            G      C 
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, 
G               C
Don't know when I'll be back again,
G    C             D
Oh, babe, I hate to go.


[Outro]

     G      C 
I'm leaving on a jet plane,
G                C
Don't know when I'll be back again,
G    C              D    G
Oh, babe, I hate to go.
