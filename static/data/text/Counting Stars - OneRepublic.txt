Am                 C
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
G                              F
Dreaming about the things that we could be
    Am               C
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
G                   
Said, no more counting dollars
F                              F
We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars


[Verse]

           Am
I see this life like a swinging vine
C
Swing my heart across the line
G
In my face is flashing signs
F
Seek it out and ye shall find
Am
Old, but I'm not that old
C
Young, but I'm not that bold
G
I don't think the world is sold
F
I'm just doing what we're told


[Pre-Chorus]

Am C                G
I feel something so right
          F
Doing the wrong thing
Am C                G
I feel something so wrong
          F
Doing the right thing
F
I could lie, could lie, could lie
F 
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive


[Chorus]

Am                 C   
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
G                              F
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Am                   C               
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
G
Said, no more counting dollars
F
We'll be counting stars
Am                 C
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
G                              F
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Am                   C
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
G                       
Said, no more counting dollars
F
We'll be, we'll be counting stars


[Verse]

           Am 
I feel the love and I feel it burn
C
Down this river, every turn
G
Hope is a four-letter word
F
Make that money, watch it burn
Am
Old, but I'm not that old
C
Young, but I'm not that bold
G
I don't think the world is sold
F
I'm just doing what we're told


[Pre-Chorus]

Am  C                 G
I feel something so wrong
          F
Doing the right thing
        F
I could lie, could lie, could lie
F
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly


[Chorus]

Am                 C
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
G                              F
Dreaming about the things that we could be

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
Sink in the river
Sink in the river
Sink in the river
The lessons are learned..
