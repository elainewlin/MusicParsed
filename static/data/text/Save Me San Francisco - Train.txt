Intro:
D  G  A  D

Verse:
D
I used to love the tenderloin
G
Until I made some tender coin
A                               D
And then I met some ladies from Marin
D
We Took the Highway to the one,
G
Up the coast to catch some sun
A                               D
That left me with these blisters on my skin
D
Don't know what I was on,
G
But I think it grows in Oregon,
A                               D
So I kept on goin' going on right through
Bm
I drove into Seattle Rain
A
Fell in love then missed the train
G
That could have took me right back home to you

Chorus:
           D               G
I've been high, I've been low,
           A                 D
I've been yes and I've been oh hell no!
           D               G
I've been rock'n roll and disco,
           A               D
Won't you save me San Francisco?

Verse:
D
Every day so caffeinated
G
I wish they were Golden Gated
A                           D
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
D
So wrap me up return to sender
G
Let's forget this five year bender
A                           D
Take me to my city by the bay!
D
I never knew all that I had,
G
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
A                           D
At least they have a helluva fine below
Bm
If I could wish upon a star
A
I would hitch a cable car
G
To the place that I can always call my own!

Chorus:
           D               G
I've been high, I've been low,
           A                 D
I've been yes and I've been oh hell no!
           D               G
I've been rock'n roll and disco,
           A               D
Won't you save me San Francisco?
           D               G
I've been up, I've been down,
            A                 D
I've been so damn lost since you're not around,
           D               G
I've been reggae and calypso
           A               D
Won't you save me San Francisco?

Bridge:
Em7             G
To tell you the truth
D               A
I miss everything, everything
Em7             G
It's a wild, wild beautiful world
                D                 A
But there's a wide eyed girl back there
                A
And she means everything, everything,

Chorus:
           D               G
I've been high, I've been low,
           A                 D
I've been yes and I've been oh hell no!
           D               G
I've been rock'n roll and disco,
           A               D
Won't you save me San Francisco?
           D               G
I've been up, I've been down,
            A                 D
I've been so damn lost since you're not around,
           D               G
I've been reggae and calypso
           A               D
Won't you save me San Francisco?
