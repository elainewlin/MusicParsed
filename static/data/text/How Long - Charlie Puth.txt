 I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
F                 G               Am     E
Can't you play my head and not my heart?
F           G           Am                   G
 I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but

I promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

                        Em    Am
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
Dm               Em          F
 She said, "Save your apologies
                   Esus4 E
Baby, I just gotta know"

          Am            E
While you callin' me "baby"

 I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
F             G             Am    E
When I say it only happened once, mmm
F       G            Am                 G
 I tried, and I tried, but you'll never see that
