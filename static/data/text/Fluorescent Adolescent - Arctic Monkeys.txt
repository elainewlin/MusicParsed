[Verse]

                            E
You used to get it in your fishnets
                             C#m
Now you only get it in your night dress
                                    F#m
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        B
Landed in a very common crisis
                            E
Everything's in order in a black hole
                               C#m
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
                                F#m
The Bloody Mary's lacking her Tabasco
                               B
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
[Chorus]

               F#m
Oh the boy's a slag
                     B
The best you ever had
                     F#m
The best you ever had
          B                F#m
Is just a memory and those dreams
               B
But as daft as they seem
               F#m
As daft as they seem
                  A
My love when you dream them up...
[Verse]

                                   E
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
                                  C#m
Remember when the boys were all electric?
                                F#m
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
                                     B
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
                             E
Clinging to not getting sentimental
                              C#m
Said she wasn't going but she went still
                               F#m
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
                                   B
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
[Chorus]

               F#m
Oh the boy's a slag
                  B
The best you ever had
                  F#m
The best you ever had
           B                F#m
Is just a memory and those dreams
                    B
But as daft as they seem
                F#m
As daft as they seem
                 A
My love when you dream them up

[Bridge]
G#m               C#m
Oh, where did you go?
              F#m
Where did you go?
              G#m  F#m
Where did you go? Woah.
E C#m F#m B
 E          C#m
Falling about
           F#m             B
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              E             C#m
You were just sounding it out
           F#m            B
You're not coming back again.
E          C#m
Falling about
           F#m             B
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              E             C#m
You were just sounding it out
           F#m            B
You're not coming back again.

                           E

                            C#m
Now you only get it in your night dress
                                     F#m
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        B
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
                               C#m
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
                              F#m
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
                              B
Remember when he used to be a rascal?
