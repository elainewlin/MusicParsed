[Verse 1]
Em                       D                   Bm             C
 I heard a glass shatter on the wall in the apartment above mine
Em          D                  Bm       C
 At first I thought that I was dreamin'
Em                          D
 But then I heard the voice of a girl
       Bm                      C
And it sounded like she'd been cryin'
Em           D             Bm       C
 Now I'm too worried to be sleepin'


[Pre-Chorus]
Em                     D
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Bm                              C
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
Em                   D                                Bm      C
 She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing


[Chorus]
         Em                              D
She said, "I think your ears are playing tricks on you"
Bm                        C
 Sweater zipped up to her chin
Em                               D
 "Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
      Bm              C
But I have to go back in
Em                               D
 Wish I could tell you about the noise
      Bm            C
But I didn't hear a thing"
              Em                                 D
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
                   Bm                          C
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
              Em                                 D
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
                   Bm                          C
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"


[Verse 2]
Em                      D
 So I was layin' on the floor of my room
     Bm             C
Cold concrete on my back
Em          D                  Bm      C
 No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
Em                  D                           Bm                  C
 I didn't want to intrude because I knew that I didn't have all the facts
Em              D                   Bm          C
 But I couldn't bear the thought of leavin' her


[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
       Em                                 D
Aim my boom box at the roof, I'm playing "Lean on Me"
   Bm                               C
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
    Em                                   D               Bm C
And when she hears the words, I hope she knows she'll be okay
       Em                                 D
Aim my boom box at the roof, I'm playing "Lean on Me"
   Bm                               C
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
    Em                                D           Bm    C
And when she hears the words, I know exactly what I'll say

[Chorus]
Em                       D
 Promise I'm not playing tricks on you
Bm                             C
 You're always welcome to come in
Em                          D
 You could stay here for an hour or two
       Bm          C
If you ever need a friend

Em                     D                  Bm              C
 We can talk about the noise, when you're ready, but till then
           Em                                 D
I say, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
                   Bm                          C
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
           Em                                 D
I say, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
                   Bm                          C
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
