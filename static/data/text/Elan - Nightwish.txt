Elan - Nightwish
[VERSE 1]

   Bb               F      C    Dm
in tongues from the time before man
            F        C7/E     F
listen to a daffodil tell her tale
              Gm                   Bb       C         Dm
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn
               F       C7/E    Dm
The meadows of heaven await harvest
    Bb        F           C        Dm
the cliffs un-jumped cold waters untouched
              F         C7/E  F
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
             Gm
Finally your number came up
     Bb    C         Dm
Free fall awaits the brave.
[CHORUS]

Dm              F              C
Come, taste the wine, race the blind
        Gm                 Dm
we will guide you from the light,
        Bbsus2                  C     C Bb C
writing naughts till the end of time..
Dm             F                C
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark,
         Gm              Dm
it feeds from the runs undone,
        Bbsus2    F                C
meet me where the cliff greets the sea...
[VERSE 2]

Bb         F          C        Dm
is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
          F         C7/E     F
returning swans and sedulous mice
                Gm
writings on the garden's book
       Bb        C         Dm
in the minute of a lover's look.
           F          C/E   Gm     Dm
Building a sandcastle close to the shore
  Bb       F            C        Dm
A house of cards from a worn out deck.
                F           C/E   Bb  F
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm,
               Gm                Bb      C    Dm
writing lyrics for the song only you can understand..
[CHORUS]

Dm              F              C
Come, taste the wine, race the blind
        Gm                 Dm
we will guide you from the light,
        Bbsus2                  C     C Bb C
writing naughts till the end of time..
Dm             F                C
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark,
         Gm              Dm
it feeds from the runs undone,
        Bbsus2    F                C
meet me where the cliff greets the sea...
[BRIDGE]

Bm
Riding hard every shooting star
        A/C#
come to life open mind
                    Em
have a laugh at the orthodox,
Bm                        D
Come, drink deep, let the dam of mind seep,
       A
Travel with great Ã‰lan
                   Em
Dance a jig at the funeral...
[FINAL CHORUS]

Fm              Ab             Eb
Come, taste the wine, race the blind
             Bbm                Fm
they will guide you from the light,
        Dbsus2                  Eb     Eb Db Eb
writing naughts till the end of time.. Ooh,
Fm             Ab               Eb
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark,
         Bbm             Fm
it feeds from the runs undone,
        Dbsus2    Ab               Eb
meet me where the cliff greets the sea...
