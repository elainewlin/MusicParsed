[Verse 1]

    F
The times we had
             A
Oh, when the wind would blow with rain and snow
     F
Were not all bad
           A
We put our feet just where they had
       F
Had to go
         A
Never to go


[Verse 2]

    F
The shattered soul
          A
Following close but nearly twice as slow
   F
In my good times
             A
There were always golden rocks to throw
F
At those who
            A
Those who admit defeat too late
               F
Those were our times
               A
Those were our times

[Chorus]

    Bb     F                Dm
And I will love to see that day
     C
That day is mine
     Bb       F
When she will marry me
   Dm            C
Outside with the willow trees

    Bb F              Dm
And play the songs in May
     C
They made me so
    Bb      F                Dm
And I would love to see that day
    C
The day was mine
