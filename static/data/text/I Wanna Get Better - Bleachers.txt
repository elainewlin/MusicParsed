[Verse 1]
    G
Hey I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
C
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
G                                       
I trace the faith to a broken down television 
D
And put on the weather
          G
And I’ve trained myself to give up on the past
         C
Cause I frozen time between hearses and caskets
G
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
D
I wanna get better

[Verse 2]
         G                                               
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls 
     C
Down parkway lines I was losing my mind
G                                               
Cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love 
       D
That I gave wasted on a nice face
G                                       C                      
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet 
                                                   G
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
                                    D
So now I’m standing on the overpass screaming at the cars hey I wanna get better

[Chorus]
G                       C
I didn’t know I was lonely til I saw your face
G               D
I wanna get better
G                       C
I didn’t know I was broken til I wanted to change
G               D
I wanna get better

[Verse 3]
G
I go up to my room and there’s girls on the ceiling
C
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
       G
Of an eighteen year old, who didn’t know what loss was
D
Now i’m a stranger
    G
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
C                                    G
Mourn the years before I got carried away
                                       D
So now i’m staring at the interstate, screaming at myself hey I wanna get better

[Bridge]
G                                    C
Cause I’m sleeping in the back of a taxi
                              G
I’m screaming from my bedroom window
                   C
Even if it’s gonna kill me

[Verse 4]
G
woke up this morning early before my family
C
from this dream where she was trying to show me
G                               D
how a life can move from the darkness, she said to get better
G                                               C                      G
so I put a bullet where I shoulda out a helmet and I crash my car cause I wanna get carried away
                                D
that’s why i’m standing on the overpass screaming at myself, hey, I WANNA GET BETTER
