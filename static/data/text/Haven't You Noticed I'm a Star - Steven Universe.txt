G                                 
I can't help it if I make a scene,

D                                Am   
Stepping out of my hot pink limousine.

Am                                         
I'm turning heads and I'm stopping traffic,

       D                                             
When I pose, they scream and when I joke, they laugh.

           G                                         
I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in,

D                                       
They're hypnotized by my way of walking,

Am                                          
I've got them dazzled like a stage magician,

       D                                              
When I point, they look, and when I talk, they listen.

      Em                C      
Well, everybody needs a friend,

                          D   
And I got you and you and you.

                      G         
So many, I can't even name them,

        D                 Am7    
Can you blame me, I'm too famous.

            G        D     Cmaj7
Haven't you noticed? I'm a star.

                G           D        Cmaj7   
I'm coming into view as the world is turning.

            G            D            Cmaj7
Haven't you noticed I've made it this far?

     G            D      Cmaj7  
Now, everyone can see me burning

     G            D      Cmaj7  
Now, everyone can see me burning

     G            B7     Em     
Now, everyone can see me burning
