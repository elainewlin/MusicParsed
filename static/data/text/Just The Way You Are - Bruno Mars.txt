Verse:
F
 Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Dm
 Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
Bb                                         F
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
Verse:
     F
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Dm
 And it's so, it's so sad to think she don't see what I see
Bb                                             F
 But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

                F                   Dm
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              Bb                        F
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             F                      Dm
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile

Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, - yeah -

Dm
 Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy

 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
Verse:
        F
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change

If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
Bb                                                            F
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say
