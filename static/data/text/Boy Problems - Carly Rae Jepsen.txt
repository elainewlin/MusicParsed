[Verse]
Bb                           F 
If you're gonna go then go, she said to me on the phone
Dm                          C
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
Bb                              F 
If you're gonna stay then stay, he's not gonna change anyway
Dm                          C
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems


[Pre Chorus]
      Bb                             F
And I know that she's right, and I should not be offended
    Dm                                  C
That I know what it looks like from the outside
      Bb                             F
And I know that she's right, and I should not be offended
     Dm                                  C
Yeah I know what it looks like, from the outside, from the outside


[Chorus]
Bb                F             Dm                 C
   Boy problems, who's got 'em? I've got 'em top
Bb               F               Dm                     C
   Boy trouble, we've got double, don't know what to do
                Bb                               F
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today, and I don't really care
        Dm                 C
I've got worse problems, I broke up with my boyfriend
                Bb                               F
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today, and I don't really care
        Dm                 C
I've got worse problems, I broke up with my boyfriend


[Verse]
Bb                      F 
Finally gotta let it go, she said to me on the phone
Dm                           C
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
Bb                           F 
It could be the perfect day, you'll just make it rain anyway
Dm                           C
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems


[Pre Chorus]
      Bb                             F
And I know that she's right, and I should not be offended
    Dm                                  C
That I know what it looks like from the outside
      Bb                             F
And I know that she's right, and I should not be offended
     Dm                                  C
Yeah I know what it looks like, from the outside, from the outside


[Chorus]
Bb                F             Dm                 C
   Boy problems, who's got 'em? I've got 'em too
Bb               F               Dm                     C
   Boy trouble, we've got double, don't know what to do
                Bb                               F

I think I broke up with my boyfriend today, and I don't really care
        Dm                 C
I've got worse problems, I broke up with my boyfriend


[Bridge]
       Am              Bb                    Dm            C
What's worse? Losin' a lover or losin' your best friend
       Am                    Bb                              Dm            
What's worse is when you discover, you're not good for each other
                               C
She's been giving, you've been taking


[Chorus]
Bb                F             Dm                 C
