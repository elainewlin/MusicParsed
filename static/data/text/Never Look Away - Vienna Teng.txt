[Verse 1]
G#m                B                 E            
Detect my sudden existence on your sonar
D#m             E
You feel the echo
G#m              B               E               
Electrify the resistance in your broken heart
D#m             E
And burn it up, oh. We’re gonna photo-
C#m              B               F#
synthesize and drink up the sunrise 
F#
Whoa oh oh whoah oh oh

[Verse 2]
G#m                   B               E          
So do they ever shut up because you said so or
D#m                  E
Do you overthink ’em all
G#m                  B               E               
Somebody ought to corrupt you on the dance floor
D#m                     E
And take you home oh oh oh. Show you all of your 
C#m              B       F#
daemons and desires and dark sides
F#
Whoa oh oh whoah oh oh. All of your
C#m              B       F#
colonies and continental divides
F#
Whoa oh oh whoah oh oh

[Instrumental x2]
G#m B E D#m E

[Verse 3]
G#m                  B              E            
Let me uncover the silver in your dark hair
D#m                 E
The weight of your bones
G#m                      B               E               
I want to witness the beauty of your repair
D#m               E
The shape you’ve grown. For you are made of
C#m              B       F#
nebulas and novas and night sky
F#
Whoa oh oh whoah oh oh. You’re made of
C#m           B        F#
memories you bury or live by
F#
Whoa oh oh whoah oh oh. 


[Chorus]
             D#m               E
So if you’re out there in the cold
                  G#m        F#
I’ll cover you in moonlight
            D#m              E
If you’re a stranger to your soul
                       G#m        F#
I’ll bring you to your birthright
           G#m                E
I want the storm inside you awoken now
            B               F#
I want your warm bright eyes
         G         A        B5
To never look away look away look away
               G         A        B5
Don’t you ever look away look away look away (x3)

[Bridge]
G#m              B               E                       
Some nights we open up the flood
D#m                     E
And some nights we are lost
G#m                      B               E                       
And some nights we’re choking on the words
                     F#
But some we light on fire

[Chorus]
          D#m               E
If you're out there in the cold
                  G#m        F#
I’ll cover you in moonlight
            D#m              E
If you’re a stranger to your soul
                       G#m        F#
I’ll bring you to your birthright
           G#m                E
I want the storm inside you awoken now
            B               F#
I want your warm bright eyes
G#m                     E
To come back to me And hold on to me
B               F#
You know I won’t lie
             G         A        B5
I will never look away look away look away
               G         A        B5
Don’t you ever look away look away look away (x3)
