[Intro]
Am G D5 D
Am G D5 D

[Verse 1]
Am
She always has a smile
     G                    D5  D
From morning to the night
    Am
The perfect poster child
     G                   D5  D
That was once in my life


[Pre-Chorus 1]
  Am
A doll made out of glass
        G                              D5  D
All her friends think that she's great
    Em        D
But I can see through it all
    C
And she's about to break


[Chorus 1]
  Am               G
Remember last year when you told me
   D                    Em         
To always stay here and never leave me
     Am                 G
The light from your eyes made it feel like
D        Em         
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight


  Am               G
Remember last year when you told me
     D                 Em         
That these will be lifelong stories
     Am                 G
The light from your eyes made it feel like
D        Em         
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight


[Post-Chorus 1]
 Am           G        D           Em 
(Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh – ooh - ooh)
                       You-ou-ou-ou were dancing in the moonlight
 Am           G        D           Em 
(Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh - ooh - ooh)
                       And I-I-I-I was dancing in the moonlight


[Verse 2]
Am
Now she lost her way
    G              D
And she forgets to smile
Am
Never gets a break
     G              D
From this life in denial


[Pre-Chorus 2]
  Am
A doll made out of glass
        G                              D5
All her friends think that she's great
    Em        D
But I can see through it all
    C
And she's about to break, oh!


[Chorus 2]
  Am               G
Remember last year when you told me
   D                    Em         
To always stay here and never leave me
     Am                 G
The light from your eyes made it feel like
D        Em         
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight


  Am               G
Remember last year when you told me
     D                 Em         
That these will be lifelong stories
     Am                 G
The light from your eyes made it feel like
D        Em         
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight


[Post-Chorus 2]
 Am           G        D           Em 
(Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh – ooh - ooh)
                       You-ou-ou-ou were dancing in the moonlight
 Am           G        D           Em 
(Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh - ooh - ooh)
                       And I-I-I-I was dancing in the moonlight


[Bridge]
Em      G           Am    Am
I, I, I, miss those memories
Em           G                 C  Cm
We used to share just you and me


[Chorus 3]
    Am               G
I remember last year when I told you
        D                    Em
I would always stay here and never leave you
  Am                 G
I told you the light in your eyes made it look like
D                     Em 
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight


  Am               G
Remember last year when you told me
   D                    Em         
To always stay here and never leave me
     Am                 G
The light from your eyes made it feel like
D        Em         
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight


[Outro]
 Am           G        D       Em 
(Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh), oh
     Am                 G                  D
The light from your eyes made it feel like
                         Em
Dancing in the moonlight
