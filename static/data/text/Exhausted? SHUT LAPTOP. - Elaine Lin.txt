[Verse]
    G       C
I'm feeling down
    G       C
I'm feeling blue
     Am
It's late at night
           F
Don't know what to do
    
[Chorus] 
     C                  G
So I shut my laptop and go to bed
Am          F
I gotta get outta my head
  
  C                  G
I shut my laptop and go to bed
Am          F
I gotta get outta my head

[Verse]
       G       C
You're feeling down
       G       C
You're feeling blue
     Am
It's late at night
           F
Don't know what to do

[Chorus] 
       C                    G 
So you shut your laptop and go to bed
Am            F 
You gotta get outta your head

C                    G
Shut your laptop and go to bed
Am        F
Gotta get outta your head
