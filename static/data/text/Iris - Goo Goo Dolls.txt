[Verse]

        D       Em         G
And I'd give up forever to touch you
         Bm            A           G
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
           D          Em          G
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
      Bm            A             G
And I don't want to go home right now


[Verse]

    D         Em            G
And all I can taste is this moment
    Bm        A               G
And all I can breathe is your life
    D         Em         G
And sooner or later it's over
       Bm            A        G
I just don't want to miss you tonight


[Chorus]

      Bm             A        G
And I don't want the world to see me
         Bm               A      G
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Bm           A          G
When everything's made to be broken
       Bm          A          G
I just want you to know who I am


[Verse]

        D               Em               G
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
       Bm        A             G
Or the moment of truth in your lies
     D          Em             G
When everything feels like the movies
          Bm            A           G
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive


[Chorus]

      Bm             A        G
And I don't want the world to see me
         Bm               A      G
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Bm           A          G
When everything's made to be broken
       Bm          A          G
I just want you to know who I am


[Chorus]

      Bm             A        G
And I don't want the world to see me
         Bm               A      G
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Bm           A          G
When everything's made to be broken
       Bm          A          G
I just want you to know who I am

       Bm          A          G
I just want you to know who I am
       Bm          A          G
I just want you to know who I am
       Bm          A          Bm
I just want you to know who I am
