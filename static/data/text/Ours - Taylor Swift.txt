[Intro]
C  Am7  Fadd9

[Verse 1]
C        Am7               Fadd9
Elevator buttons and morning air
C                  Am7                     Fadd9
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
C                      Am7               Fadd9
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
          C    G/B        Fadd9
But right now, my time is theirs
   C               Am7                    Fadd9
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
        C                  Am7               Fadd9
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
        C                  Am7                Fadd9
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
           C    G/B              Fadd9  G
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
   Fadd9                G
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
C                     Am7
People throw rocks at things that shine
    Fadd9      G         Am7
And life makes love look hard
               Fadd9
The stakes are high
            G
The water's rough
                 C  Am7  Fadd9    C  Am7  Fadd9
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
    C               Am7                  Fadd9
You never know what people have up their sleeves
C                     Am7               Fadd9
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
C              Am7                Fadd9
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
            C    G/B                     Fadd9  G
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine

[Chorus]
               Fadd9                G
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
C                     Am7
People throw rocks at things that shine
    Fadd9      G         Am7
And life makes love look hard
               Fadd9
The stakes are high
            G
The water's rough
                 C  Am7  Fadd9    C  Am7  Fadd9
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
Am7           G/B            Fadd9
 And it's not theirs to speculate
        Am7   G/B  
If it's wrong and  
Am7             G/B                Fadd9        
 your hands are tough but they are where 
        Am7 G/B    
mine belong and
Am7               G/B                Fadd9          
 I'll fight their doubt and give you faith 
     Am7  G/B  Fadd9
with this song for   you

[Verse 3]
C                Am7              Fadd9
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
C              Am7              Fadd9
And I love the riddles that you speak
        C                     Am7          
And any snide remarks from my father 
      Fadd9                  C
about your tattoos will be ignored
         G/B      Fadd9  G
Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus/Outro]
   Fadd9                G
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
C                     Am7
People throw rocks at things that shine
    Fadd9      G         Am7
And life makes love look hard
   Fadd9                G
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
C                     Am7
People throw rocks at things that shine
    Fadd9      G           C   Am7
But they can't take what's ours
Fadd9      G           Am7
They can't take what's ours
               Fadd9
The stakes are high
            G
The water's rough
                 C
But this love is ours
