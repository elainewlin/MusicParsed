[Verse]

 C
don't you worry, there my honey
 F
we might not have any money
 Am                               F
but we've got our love to pay the bills

 C
maybe I think you're cute and funny,
 F                            Am
maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you,
                   F
if you know what I mean


[Chorus]

     C                 E               F                     C
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                             E
let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
    F                 G
and teach them how to dance
          C                  E
let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
       F                   D
making everybody look like ants
            C              F  G       C
from way up there, you and I, you and I


[Verse]

C
well you might be a bit confused
    F
and you might be a little bit bruised
    Am                            F
but baby how we spoon like no one else
   C
so I will help you read those books
   F
if you will soothe my worried looks
    Am                              F
and we will put the lonesome on the shelf


[Chorus]

     C                 E               F                     C
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                             E
let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
    F                 G
and teach them how to dance
          C                  E
let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
       F                   D
making everybody look like ants
            C              F  G       C
from way up there, you and I, you and I
