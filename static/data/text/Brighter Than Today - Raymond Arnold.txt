C
Countless winter nights ago,
G
A woman shivered in the cold.
Am
Cursed the skies, and wondered why
F
The gods invented pain.

C
Aching angry flesh and bone,
G
Bitterly she struck the stone
Am
Till she saw the sudden spark
F
Of light, and golden flame.

C
She showed the others, but they told her
G
She was not fit to control
Am
The primal forces that the gods
F
Had cloaked in mystery

C
But she would not be satisfied,
G
And though she trembled, she defied
Am
Lit her torch and raised it high
F             G
And set afire history... o-oh


Chorus:
F                                Am
Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day, although the night is cold
C                                G
The stars may seem so very far a-way
F                                     Am
But courage, hope and reason burn, in every mind, each lesson learned,
C                               G                              Am
Shining light to guide our way, make tomorrow brighter than to-day

F             Am
Oh............oh...
F             Am
Oh............oh...
G                      C
Oh... Brighter than to-day.

C
Ages long forgotten now,
G
We built the wheel and then the plough.
Am
Tilled the earth and proved our worth
F
Against the drought and snow.

C
Soon we had the time to fathom
G
Mountain peaks and tiny atoms,
Am
Beating hearts, electric sparks,
F
There's so much more to kno-ow.

Chorus:
F                                A
Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day, although the night is cold
C                                G
The stars may seem so very far a-way
F                                       A
But courage, hope and reason grow, with every passing season so
C                                  G                              Am
We'll drive the darkness far away, make tomorrow brighter than to-day

F             Am
Oh............oh...
F             Am
Oh............oh...
G                      C
Oh... Brighter than to-day.

C
The universe may seem unfair.
G
The laws of nature may not care.
Am
Storms and quakes, our own mistakes,
F
They nearly doused our flame.

C
But all these trials we’ve endured
G
The lessons learned, diseases cured
Am
Against our herculean task
F
We’ve risen to proclaim.


Chorus:
F                                A
Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day, although the night is cold
C                                G
The stars may seem so very far a-way
F                                     A
But courage, hope and reason bloom, a-cross the world and one day soon
C                                   G                              Am
We'll rise up to the stars and say, make tomorrow brighter than to-day

F             Am
Oh............oh...
F             Am
Oh............oh...
G                      C
Oh... Brighter than to-day.
