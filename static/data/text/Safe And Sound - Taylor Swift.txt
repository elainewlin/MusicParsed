 
Verse:
Am                         Em
I remember tears streaming down your face
         Cmaj7                  G
When I said, I'll never let you go
Am                     Em                  Cmaj7    G
When all those shadows almost killed your light
Am          Em             Cmaj7          G 
I remember you said, Don't leave me here alone
Am                      Em              Cmaj7
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
 
Chorus:
Cmaj7              G
Just close your eyes
     D             Cmaj7
The sun is going down
             G
You'll be alright
    D              Cmaj7
No one can hurt you now
              G
Come morning light
D           Cmaj7     D   Cmaj7
You and I'll be safe and sound
 
Verse:
Am                   Em              Cmaj7
Don't you dare look out your window darling
                G
everything's on fire
Am                   Em               Cmaj7     G
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Am     Em      Cmaj7   G 
Hold onto this lullaby
Am     Em            Cmaj7
Even when the music's gone
Cmaj7
Gone
 
Chorus:
Cmaj7              G

You'll be alright
    D              Cmaj7
No one can hurt you now
              G
Come morning light
D           Cmaj7     D   Cmaj7
You and I'll be safe and sound
