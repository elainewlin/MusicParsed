Verse:
C                                               Em
 Your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the sky.
C                                            Em
 Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you die.
F                                                    Am
 And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time.
                                  C
I've been putting out fires all my life.
                                                   G
Everybody wants a flame, but they don't want to get burnt.
                      C
And today is our turn.

Chorus:
C                        Am                       F
 Days like these lead to, nights like this lead to love like ours,
             Am                  G
You light the spark in my bonfire heart.
C                        Am
 People like us, we don't need that much.
        F                           Am                   G
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts.

Verse:
C                                                Em
 This world is getting colder. Strangers passing by.
C                                                      Em
 No one offers you a shoulder. No one looks you in the eye.
F                                              Am
 But I've been looking at you for a long, long time.
                                                C
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine.
                                               G
Everybody wants a flame, they don't want to get burnt
                       C
Well today is our turn.
