[Verse]

F                                          F Bb C Bb
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
F                                          F Bb C Bb
Sunshine she's here,  You can take a break
      F                                       F Bb C Bb
I'm a hot air balloon, That could go to space
         F                                          F Bb C Bb
With the air, Like I don't care,  Baby by the way


[Chorus]

            Dbmaj7             Cm7                
Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel, 
       Eb             F
Like a room without a roof
            Dbmaj7             Cm7               
Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel like, 
Eb               F
Happiness is the truth
            Dbmaj7             Cm7               
Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you know what, 
Eb              F
Happiness is to you
            Dbmaj7             Cm7               
Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel like, 
Eb                      F
That's what you want to do


[Verse]

F                                         F Bb C Bb
Here come bad news, Talking this and that
F                                        F Bb C Bb
Give me all you got,  Don't hold it back
F                                                  F Bb C Bb
Well I should probably warn you, I'll be just fine
F                                         F Bb C Bb
No offense to you, Don't waste your time
