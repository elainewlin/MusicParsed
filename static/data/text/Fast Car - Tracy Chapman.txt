[Verse 1]
F              C
You got a fast car
Am                 G
I want a ticket to anywhere
F                   C
Maybe we can make a deal
Am                    G
Maybe together we can get somewhere
F           C
Anyplace is better
Am                     G
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
F                C
Maybe we'll make something
Am                 G
Me myself I've got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
    F                  C
See my old man's got a problem
   Am                             G
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
            F                  C
He says his body's too old for working
    Am                  G
His body's too young to look like his
   F                  C
My momma went off and left him
    Am                         G
She wanted more from life than he could give
       F                C
I said somebody's gotta take care of him
Am                          G
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Chorus]
                           F
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
C                  
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
Am  
City lights lay out before us
         G
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
    F C       G
and I-I had a feeling that I belonged
    F C       G
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, 
F           G          
be someone, be someone

[Verse 3]
F              C
You got a fast car
Am                     G
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
F                     C
You still ain't got a job
  Am                    G
I work in a market as a checkout girl
F                      C
I know things will get better
Am                   G
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
F                     C
We'll move out of the shelter
Am                     G
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Verse 4]
F              C
You got a fast car
      Am                     G
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
F                 C
We gotta make a decision
Am                        G
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
                           F
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
C                  
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
Am  
City lights lay out before us
         G
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
    F C       G
and I-I had a feeling that I belonged
    F C       G
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, 
F           G          
be someone, be someone
