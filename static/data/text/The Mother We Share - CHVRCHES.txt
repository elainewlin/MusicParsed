
[Intro]

C#     Fm     F#


[Verse]

      Bbm                    G#               C#
Never took your side, never cursed your name;
           F#                           G#
I keep my lips shut tight until you go.
      Bbm                   G#
We've come as far as we're ever gonna get
           F#
until you realize that you should go.


[Chorus]
        C#                          Fm
I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens,
         F#
and the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling.
     C#                               Fm
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me,
         F#
and the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling.


[Verse]

       Bbm                     G#            C#
In the dead of night, I'm the only one here
            F#                     G#
and I will cover you until you go;
            Bbm                     G#
'cause if I told the truth, I will always be free
            F#
and keep a prize with me until you go.


[Chorus]

        C#                          Fm
I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens,
         F#
and the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling.
     C#                               Fm
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me,
         F#
and the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling.

Bbm     G#     F#


[Verse]

          Bbm                        Fm
Into the night, for once, we're the only ones left.
           F#
I bet you even know where we could go.
            Bbm                         Fm
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands;
        F#
it's a souvenir for when you go.


[Chorus]

        C#                          Fm
I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens,
         F#
and the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling.
     C#                               Fm
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me,
         F#
and the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling.
