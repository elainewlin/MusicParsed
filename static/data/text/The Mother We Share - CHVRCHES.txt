CAPO 1

[Intro]

C     Em     F
[Verse]

      Am                    G               C
Never took your side, never cursed your name;
           F                           G
I keep my lips shut tight until you go.
      Am                   G
We've come as far as we're ever gonna get
           F
until you realize that you should go.
[Chorus]

        C                          Em
I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens,
         F
and the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling.
     C                               Em
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me,
         F
and the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling.
[Verse]

       Am                     G            C
In the dead of night, I'm the only one here
            F                     G
and I will cover you until you go;
            Am                     G
'cause if I told the truth, I will always be free
            F
and keep a prize with me until you go.
[Chorus]

        C                          Em
I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens,
         F
and the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling.
     C                               Em
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me,
         F
and the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling.
Am     G     F
[Verse]

          Am                        Em
Into the night, for once, we're the only ones left.
           F
I bet you even know where we could go.
            Am                         Em
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands;
        F
it's a souvenir for when you go.
[Chorus]

        C                          Em
I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens,
         F
and the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling.
     C                               Em
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me,
         F
and the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling.
