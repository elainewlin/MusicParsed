[Verse 1]
Em         C            G             D
Let me rewind to the times where we never felt ill
Em           C                G             D
We fill our minds with those dreams and we never miss a beat
Em             C           G            D
Just pass the time staying up, feeling restless at night
Em           C            G         D            Em 
Come wake me up before I die and I never get to live

[Chorus]
Em         C           G           D
I want a house on the hill by the ocean
Em           C          G           D
I'd let the tide wash away all my critical mistakes
Em         C           G           D
I want a house on the hill by the ocean
Em           C          G           D
I'd let the tide wash away all my critical mistakes

Em C G D

[Verse 2]
Em               C           G                D
Let's spend the days, empty space, watch the waves in our mind
Em            C                G            D
We count the stars, write our names in the sand beneath our feet
Em           C             G               D
It feels so right blowing smoke clouds polluting the sky
Em          C               G        D                    Em 
You take a drag before the moment escapes you, feel the light

[Chorus]
Em         C           G           D
I want a house on the hill by the ocean
Em           C          G           D
I'd let the tide wash away all my critical mistakes
Em         C           G           D
I want a house on the hill by the ocean
Em           C          G           D
I'd let the tide wash away all my critical mistakes

[Bridge] 
Em        C       G      D
Let me rewind (rewind)
Em           C          G      D
We fill our minds (our minds)
Em        C              G             D
Let me rewind   (to the times, where we never felt ill)
Em           C              G              D
we fill our minds,(our minds) We fill our minds with smoke

[Chorus]
Em         C           G           D
I want a house on the hill by the ocean
Em           C          G           D
I'd let the tide wash away all my critical mistakes
Em         C           G           D
I want a house on the hill by the ocean
Em           C          G           D
I'd let the tide wash away all my critical mistakes
