[Verse 1]

D                    Am             Am                    Em
Lights go out and I can't be saved, tides that I tried to swim against
D                 Am           Am         Em
Brought me down upon my knees, oh I beg I beg and plead -singing
D               Am             Am             Em
Come out of the things unsaid, shoot an apple off my head - and a
D              Am            Am             Em
trouble that can't be named, tigers waiting to be tamed - singing

[Verse 2]

  D       Am                             Em
Confusion never stops, closing walls and ticking clocks - gonna
D             Am                                 Em
come back and take you home, I could not stop that she now know - singing
D             Am                        Em
Come out upon my seas, curse missed opportunities - am I
D       Am                            Em
a part of the cure, or am I a part of the disease? - singing
