[Verse 1]                                                   
Cm7    Ebsus2         F7        Cm7 Ebsus2 F7                
   I'm not scared of you now, or so I say
Cm7        Ebsus2        F7   Cm7        Ebsus2 F7
   There's no reason to run, although I may
Cm7        Ebsus2      F       Cm7       Ebsus2  F7
   I'm not as sure as I seem, this much I know
Cm7           Ebsus2           F7         Cm7   Ebsus2 F7
   What does it mean when you leave and I   follow

[Chorus]
        Cm7                  Cm7/Bb
I could try to forget what you do when I let you get
Ab6                               Eb
Through to me but then you do it over again
 Bb/D     Cm7                             Fdim7
  I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire
         Fm                     Eb
‘Til you get to me on my morningside

[Interlude]
Cm7   Ebsus2     F7    Cm7  Ebsus2    F7
Oh oho ooh yeah yeah,     yeah yeah yey

[Verse 2]
Cm7    Ebsus2          F7    Cm7  Ebsus2  F7
   Keep my distance I tried,    no use no
Cm7   Ebsus2          F7    Cm7   Ebsus2     F7
   But no matter the miles,    I'm back to you

[Chorus]
        Cm7                  Cm7/Bb
I could try to forget what you do when I let you get
Ab6                               Eb
Through to me but then you do it over again
 Bb/D     Cm7                             Fdim7
  I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire
         Fm                     Eb
‘Til you get to me on my morningside
       Cm7                     Cm7/Bb
Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever
    Ab6                            Eb
I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
 Bb/D  Cm7                  Fdim7
 Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
        Fm                           Eb
What it looks like here on my morningside

[Bridge]
Ab6                                 Cm
   Look back don't you dare let me start to do that
                    Ab6
I don't care if the things that I have
              Cm   Bb/D Eb   Eb/G Ab6
Only make me afraid to  lose I   need to let go
                     Cm
Need to want to keep letting you know
                    Ab6
That we both have a reason to follow
           Cm  Bb/D Eb    Eb/G  Ab   Bb  B
Long as we let this lead I'm   barely breathing

[Chorus]
  Cm7     Cm7/Bb          Ab6                          Eb
I try to forget what you do to me but then you do it over again
        Cm7                  Fdim7
I could rage and you'd bring rain
         Fm                     Eb
‘Til you get to me on my morningside
       Cm7                  Cm7/Bb
Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever
    Ab6                            Eb
I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
Bb/D   Cm7                   Fdim7
  Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
        Fm                           Eb
What it looks like here on my morningside
