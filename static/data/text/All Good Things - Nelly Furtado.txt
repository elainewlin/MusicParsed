[Verse]
Am                   C
Honestly what will become of me
             G
I don't like reality
              F
It's way too clear to me
   Am               C
But really life is daily
           G
We are what we don't see
           F                     Am
We missed everything daydreaming

[Chorus]
 Am          C
 Flames to dust
             G
 Lovers to friends
          F                        Am
 Why do all good things come to an end
 Am          C
 Flames to dust
             G
 Lovers to friends
          F                        Am
 Why do all good things come to an end
 Am          C             G           
 come to an end come to an     
        F                         Am      
 Why do all good things come to an end


[Verse]
Am                           C
Travelling I always stop at exits
                   G
Wondering if I'll stay
              F
Young and restless

Living this way I stress less
Am                              C
I want to pull away when the dream dies
                    G
The pain sets it and I don't cry
              F
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

[Chorus]
[Verse]
Am                             C
Well the dogs were whistling a new tune
               G
Barking at the new moon
                   F
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Am                    C
Dogs were whistling a new tune
               G
Barking at the new moon
                   F
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Am   C  Am   G
Die die die die

[Chorus]
[Verse]
Am                              C
Well the dogs were barking at a new moon
            G
Whistling a new tune
                 F
Hoping it would come soon
         Am                 C                        G                      F         
And the sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day 'til the feeling went away
        Am                     C
And the sky was falling on the clouds were dropping and
     G                F
the rain forgot how to bring salvation
   Am                         C
the dogs were barking at the new moon
            G
Whistling a new tune
                 F                           Am
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die
