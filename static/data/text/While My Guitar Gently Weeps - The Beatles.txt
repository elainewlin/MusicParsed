[Verse]

  Bm           Bm/A       Gm7♭5            Gmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Bm          A          E        F#
While my guitar gently weeps
  Bm           Bm/A       Gm7♭5          Gmaj7
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Bm          A          D        F#
Still my guitar gently weeps


[Chorus]

B            D#m  G#m   D#m      C#m                  F#
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
B            D#m G#m           D#m
I don't know how   someone controlled you
C#m                   F#
They bought and sold you


[Verse]

  Bm           Bm/A       Gm7♭5      Gmaj7
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
Bm          A          E        F#
While my guitar gently weeps
  Bm             Bm/A      Gm7♭5    Gmaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Bm          A          D        F#
Still my guitar gently weeps


[Chorus]

B            D#m  G#m       D#m
I don't know how you were diverted
C#m                 F#
You were perverted too
B            D#m   G#m      D#m
I don't know how you were inverted
C#m             F#
No one alerted you


[Verse]

  Bm           Bm/A       Gm7♭5            Gmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Bm          A          E        F#
While my guitar gently weeps
  Bm           Bm/A       Gm7♭5            Gmaj7
Look at you all...
Bm          A          D        F#
Still my guitar gently weeps
