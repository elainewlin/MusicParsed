[Verse 1] 
Am             
Crushing loneliness
   F             
It paralyzes you
C               
But there’s more to life than
G         
Crying in your room

Am F C G

[Verse 2]
Am                  
So-called friends - why does
   F
It hurt so much to trust?
C             
But there’s more to life than
G            
Jerks who betray you

[Pre-Chorus]
Dm 
I know you’re not broken 
  F
I know that you are loved
C
I know you’re not broken

[Bridge]
D                          A
You hear the sobbing from another room
           Em
How can we find connection
        G
when we fear rejection?
D                          A
You hear the sobbing from another room
           Em
How can we find connection
        G
when we fear rejection? Oh - oh - oh.
D                           A
You heard the sobbing from another room
            Em                G
And then we found connection

[Chorus]
                  D
That's why I’m so happy that I met you

Remember why I love you
Em
We can find a path cuz
G
I see the light for you

D
So happy that I met you
     A
Remember why I love you
Em
We can find a path cuz
G
I see the light for you
