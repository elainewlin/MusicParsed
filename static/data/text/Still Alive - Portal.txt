            Bm  D  Bm          
This was a triumph
D            Bm         D        Bm  D
I’m making a note here: huge success
Em               A             D    Bm    D   
It’s hard to overstate my satisfaction
Bm       D       Bm       D
Aperture Science
Bm            D      Bm       D       
We do what we must because we can
Em              A
For the good of all of us
Bb7
Except the ones who are dead
F                    C           Bb       F
But there’s no sense crying over every mistake
F                C               Bb         F
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
Gm                   C            F           Dm
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
Bb                      A      D    Bm   D 
For the people who are still alive
 
 
Bm           D         Bm         D
I’m not even angry
Bm        D     Bm         D        
I’m being so sincere right now
Em              A                  D        Bm    D 
Even though you broke my heart and killed me
Bm             D       Bm       D
And tore me to pieces
Bm              D      Bm    D       
And threw every piece into a fire
Em                A
As they burned it hurt because
Bb7
I was so happy for you
F                   C           Bb        F
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
F                C             Bb         F
And we’re out of beta, we’re releasing on time
Gm                C                F                 Dm
So I’m glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
Bb                      A      D    Bm   D 
For the people who are still alive
 
 
Bm           D         Bm         D
Go ahead and leave me
Bm             D      Bm     D        Bm
I think I’d prefer to stay inside
Em                A               D        Bm    D 
Maybe you’ll find someone else to help you
Bm          D       Bm       D
Maybe Black Mesa
Bm         D        Bm      D       
That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance
Em          A
Anyway this cake is great
Bb7
It’s so delicious and moist
F                C                    Bb         F
Look at me still talking when there’s science to do
F               C                 Bb           F
When I look out there it makes me glad I’m not you
Gm                  C             F              Dm
I’ve experiments to run, there is research to be done
Bb                     A      D    
On the people who are still alive
 
 
       D         Bm        D
And believe me I am still alive
          D          Bm          D     Bm
I’m doing science and I’m still alive
       D            Bm          D     Bm
I feel fantastic and I’m still alive
                 D         Bm         D     Bm
And while you’re dying I’ll be still alive
                D          Bm         D     Bm
And when you’re dead I will be still alive
      Bm           D      
Still alive, still alive
