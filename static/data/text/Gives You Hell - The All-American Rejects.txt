[Intro]

E    C#m   A       
E    C#m   A   


[Verse]

   E            C#m            A
I wake up every evening
                       E             
With a big smile on my face
       C#m                  A
And it never feels out of place
    E                     C#m            A
And you're still probably working
             E          
At a 9 to 5 pace
    C#m                  A
I wonder how bad that tastes


[Chorus]

                E
When you see my face
                   C#m                      A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                 E
When you walk my way
                  C#m                        A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell


[Verse]

    E                   C#m                  A          
Now where's your picket fence, love?
                       E
And where's that shiny car?
    C#m                    A
And did it ever get you far?
     E               C#m                 A   
You never seemed so tense, love
                             E
I've never seen you fall so hard
 C#m                   A
Do you know where you are?


[Pre-Chorus]

    B                C#m
And truth be told, I miss you
    B                  A7
And truth be told, I'm lying


[Chorus]

                E
When you see my face
                  C#m                         A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                  E
When you walk my way
                  C#m                        A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
              E                  C#m                    A
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
            C#m                    B
Then he's a fool, you're just as well 
                  A7
Hope it gives you hell
                    E         C#m   A     E   C#m  A
I hope it gives you hell


[Verse]

     E             C#m                A
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself,
                     E
"Where did it all go wrong?"
        C#m                A
But the list goes on and on 


[Pre-Chorus]

    B                C#m
And truth be told, I miss you
    B                  A7
And truth be told, I'm lying


[Chorus]

                E
When you see my face
                  C#m                         A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                  E
When you walk my way
                  C#m                        A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
              E                  C#m                    A
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
            C#m                    B
Then he's a fool, you're just as well 
                  A7
Hope it gives you hell


[Bridge]

     C#m       
Now you'll never see
      A
What you've done to me
        E
You can take back your memories
        G#m          F#m        E
They're no good to me
     C#m
And here's all your lies
         A7
You can look me in the eyes
         F#m
With the sad, sad look
          B
That you wear so well


[Chorus]

                E
When you see my face
                                           A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                 C#m
When you walk my way
                  B                       E
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

              E                                      A
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
            C#m                    B
Then he's a fool, you're just as well 
                  E
Hope it gives you hell

                E
When you see my face
                                           A
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                 C#m
When you walk my way
                  B                       E
Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell


[Outro]

                   E                                           A
When you hear this song and you sing along, well, you'll never tell
               C#m                B
And you're the fool, I'm just as well
                    E
I hope it gives you hell
                   C#m                B                E
When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell
             C#m                 B                            
You can sing along I hope that it puts you through hell
