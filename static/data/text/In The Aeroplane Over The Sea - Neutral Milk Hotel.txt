G Em C D

G                 Em
What a beautiful face
                       C
I have found in this place
                  D
that is circling all around the sun.
G                  Em
What a beautiful dream
                          C
that could flash on the screen
                  D                    G
in a blink of an eye and be gone from me
      Em
soft and sweet
         C                 D                G Em C D
let me hold it close and keep it here with me


 G                   Em
and one day we will die
                    C                      D
and our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
 G                   Em
but for now we are young
                  C
let us lay in the sun
                D                        G
and count every beautiful thing we can see
      Em    
Love to be
        C               D              G   Em C D
in the arms of all i'm keepin here with me

 G              Em                       C       
what a curious life we have found here tonight
                     D        
there is music that sounds from the street
 G                       Em
there are lights in the cloud
                 C
Anne's ghost all around
                        D                          G
hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
     Em
soft and sweet
        C                  D                G   Em C D
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Em                   C
now how I remember you
                                  G
how I would push my fingers through
                                    D
your mouth to make those muscles move
                                       Em
that make your voice so smooth and sweet
                                  C
And now we keep where we don't know
                                  G
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
                             D
with one you loved so long ago
                               Em C G D
now he don't even know his name

 G                 Em
What a beautiful face
                      C
I have found in this place
                  D                   
that is circling all round the sun
 G                     Em
and when we meet on a cloud
                      C
I'll be laughing out loud
                       D          G
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
     Em
Can't believe
     C                 D            G  Em C D  G
how strange it is to be anything at all
