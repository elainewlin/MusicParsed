[Verse 1]

Dm       G                C    
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Dm           G             C    
Steal some covers, share some skin
Dm           G               C    
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,
  Dm               G                 C    
you twist to fit the mold that I am in
    Dm                 G             C    
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
            Dm             G                C    
and I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
     Dm               G               C    
That someday it would lead me back to you
     Dm               G               C    
That someday it would lead me back to you


[Chorus]

            Dm  G C    
That may be all I need
                   Dm  G C    
In darkness she is all I see
                   Dm    G    C    
Come and rest your bones with me
                       Dm 
Driving slow on Sunday morning
      G             C    
and I never want to leave


[Verse 2]

Dm        G                C    
Fingers trace your every outline
Dm        G               C    
Paint a picture with my hands
Dm         G                   C    
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
           Dm             G                C    
Change the weather, still together when it ends


[Chorus]

            Dm  G C    
That may be all I need
                   Dm  G C    
In darkness she is all I see
                   Dm    G    C    
Come and rest your bones with me
                       Dm 
Driving slow on Sunday morning
      G             C    
and I never want to leave

[Bridge]

    Dm                 G             C    
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
       Dm               G                C    
Sunday morning, rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
        Dm            G                C    
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you,
       Dm           G                   C    
find a way to bring myself back home to you


[Chorus]

            Dm  G C    
That may be all I need
                   Dm  G C    
In darkness she is all I see
                   Dm    G    C    
Come and rest your bones with me
                       Dm 
Driving slow on Sunday morning
      G             C    
and I never want to leave
