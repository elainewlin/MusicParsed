Gm            C                        Dm
City of stars, are you shining just for me?
Gm            C                            F
City of stars, there's so much that I can't see
    Gm    C                            F      F/E         Dm7
Who knows? I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you

     Gm       A                            Dm   Dm7
That now, our dreams, they've finally come true
Gm            C                        Dm
City of stars, just one thing everybody wants
Gm                C                                   F
There in the bars, and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
     Gm   C                             F          F/E     Dm7
It's love, yes all we're looking for is love, from someone else

Gm                       A
A rush,       a glance,  a touch,      a dance

[Duet]
  Bb                  C                     A
A look in somebody's eyes, to light up the skies
             Dm               Dm7
To open the world and send it reeling
  Bb                      C                     Dm
A voice that says I'll be here, and you'll be alright

Bb                C                        A
I don't care if I know, just where I will go
                   Dm                Dm7
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
  Bb                A
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

[Sebastian]
                       Dm  Dm7
I think I want it to stay

Gm            C                        F
City of stars, are you shining just for me?
Gm              A
City of stars

[Mia]
                          Dm
You never shined so brightly
