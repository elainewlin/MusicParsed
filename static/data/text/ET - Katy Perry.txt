[Verse]

Em
You're so hypnotising
C
could you be the devil, could you be an angel
G
Your touch magnetising
D
feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
Em
They say "be afraid"
C
you're not like the others, futuristic lovers
G                      D
Different DNA, they don't understand you


[Pre-Chorus]

                  C         D
You're from a whole other world
  Em
a different dimension
    C        D
You open my eyes
        Em                                D (one strum/pick)
and I'm ready to go, lead me into the light


[Chorus]

Em         
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
C                                      
infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
G         
Take me, ta-ta-take me
D                                
wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
C       D            Em                     C
(Boy), you're an alien, your touch so for-eign
     D         Em
it's supernatural, extraterrestrial


[Verse]

Em
You're so supersonic
C
want to feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
G                             D
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic

[Bridge]

C        (D)           C    (D)                  
This is transcendental, on another level
G                          D
boy, you're my lucky star
C        (D)
I wanna walk on your wavelength
C        (D)
and be there when you vibrate
Em                     D
for you I'd risk it all......all
