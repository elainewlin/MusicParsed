Bbm                    Gb       Fm
Oh no I just keep on falling (Back to the same old)
Bbm                 Ebm          Db         F
Where's hope when misery comes crawling? (Oh, oh way hey)
Bbm                                Gb         Fm
With your faith you'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
Bbm             Ebm             Db  F
Kill off this common sense of mind


[Pre-Chorus]
           Ebm             Bbm
It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
          Gb                        Ebm
You can't down it with your eyes So we don't need the headlines
Ab
We don't need the headlines We just want
Bbm
(We just want the airwaves back) x2


[Chorus]
Gb          Db        Fm                 Gb
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Bbm                      Ab
Tell me tell me do you feel the pressure now?
Gb          Db        Fm                Gb
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Bbm                      Ab                Gb
Tell me tell me do you feel the pressure now?


[Verse]
Bbm                         Gb          Fm
Right now you're the only reason (I'm not letting go oh)
Bbm                Ebm            Db      F
And time out if everyones worth pleasing
Bbm                              Gb        Fm 
(Ah woah oh) You'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
Bbm                 Ebm             Db  F
To kill off their finite state of mind


[Pre-Chorus]
           Ebm             Bbm
It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
