Bbm                    F#       Fm
Oh no I just keep on falling (Back to the same old)
Bbm                 Ebm          C#         F
Where's hope when misery comes crawling? (Oh, oh way hey)
Bbm                                F#         Fm
With your faith you'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
Bbm             Ebm             C#  F
Kill off this common sense of mind


[Pre-Chorus]
           Ebm             Bbm
It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
          F#                        Ebm
You can't down it with your eyes So we don't need the headlines
G#
We don't need the headlines We just want
Bbm
(We just want the airwaves back) x2


[Chorus]
F#          C#        Fm                 F#
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Bbm                      G#
Tell me tell me do you feel the pressure now?
F#          C#        Fm                F#
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Bbm                      G#                F#
Tell me tell me do you feel the pressure now?


[Verse]
Bbm                         F#          Fm
Right now you're the only reason (I'm not letting go oh)
Bbm                Ebm            C#      F
And time out if everyones worth pleasing
Bbm                              F#        Fm 
(Ah woah oh) You'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
Bbm                 Ebm             C#  F
To kill off their finite state of mind


[Pre-Chorus]
           Ebm             Bbm
It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
