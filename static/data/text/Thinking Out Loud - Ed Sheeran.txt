[Verse]

C          Am7                         
 When your legs don't work 
          F             G 
Like they used to before
C            Am7                   F    G 
 And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C          Am7                        
 Will your mouth still remember 
    F               G
The taste of my love
C          Am7                
 Will your eyes still smile 
F               G
From your cheeks                        
            C  Am7           F    G              C   Am7  F  G
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're seventy
           C   Am7                   F  G           C    Am7  
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
F                 G
And I'm thinking 'bout how 


[Pre-Chorus]

Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                        G
Maybe just the touch of a hand
     Dm                            G         Am
Well me I fall in love with you every single day 
    Dm                      G  
And I just wanna tell you I am


[Chorus]

         C    Am7  F
So honey now
        G                C   Am7  F
Take me into your loving arms 
        G                    C           Am7  F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
           G                  C     Am7
Place your head on my beating heart 
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud
          Am  G     F    C     F     G  C
And maybe we  found love right where we are


[Verse]

C        Am7                       F           G
 When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
C        Am7                      F    G
 And the crowds don't remember my name
C        Am7         F                    G           C
 When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
       Am7                        F    G
I know you will still love me the same
              C   Am7             F    G                 C  Am7  F  G
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           C    Am7           F     G            C  Am7  F  
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
              G
I'm thinking 'bout how


[Pre-Chorus] 

Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
    Dm                       G
And maybe it's all part of a plan
     Dm                           Am     Am7
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Dm                      G   
Hoping that you'll understand


[Chorus]

          C    Am7 F
That baby now, oooooh
        G                C   Am7  F
Take me into your loving arms 
        G                    C           Am7  F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
           G                  C     Am7
Place your head on my beating heart 
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud
           Am  G     F    C     F     G  C
That maybe we  found love right where we are, oh oh
