
[Intro]

C                   B7
Putting my defenses up
       Em                    Am
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
     C
If I ever did that
    D
I think I'd have a heart attack


[Verse]

C                 G              D
Never put my love out on the line
               Em             C
Never said yes to the right guy
                  G                 D
Never had trouble getting what I want
                          Em                  C
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough

       G       D
When I don't care
           Em                 C
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
           G     D
Won't wash my hair
                   Em              C
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

                G                D
But you make me wanna act like a girl
               Em            C
Paint my nails and wear high heels
                G
Yes you make me so nervous
       B7
That I just can't hold your hand


[Chorus]

            C        G   D
You make me glo-o-o-o-o-ow, but I cover up
Em           C        G   D
Won't let it sho-o-o-o-o-ow, so I'm
C                   B7
Putting my defenses up
       Em                    Am
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
     C
If I ever did that
                           Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D                   Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D   
I think I'd have a heart attack


[Verse]

C                   G                 D
Never break a sweat for the other guys
                      Em              C
When ya come around, I get paralyzed
                    G          D
And every time I try to be myself
                   Em                C
It comes out wrong like a cry for help

          G      D
It's just not fair
                    Em              C
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
       G     D
I gasp for air
                 Em                   C
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

                G                D
But you make me wanna act like a girl
               Em           C
Paint my nails and wear perfume
                G
For you, make me so nervous
       B7
That I just can't hold your hand


[Chorus]

            C       G   D
You make me glo-o-o-o-o-ow, but I cover up
Em           C        G   D
Won't let it sho-o-o-o-o-ow, so Iâ€™m
C                   B7
Putting my defenses up
       Em                    Am
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
     C
If I ever did that
                           Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D                   Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D                   Em
I think I'd have a heart attack


[Bridge]

               C
The feelings are lost in my lungs
                     G
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
            D                   Em
And there's no one else to blame
                     C
So scared I'd take off in a run
               G
I'm flying too close to the sun
                   B7
And I burst into flames


[Chorus]

            C        G   D
You make me glo-o-o-o-o-ow, but I cover up
Em           C        G   D
Won't let it sho-o-o-o-o-ow, so I'm
C                   B7
Putting my defenses up
       Em                    Am
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
     C
If I ever did that
                           Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-A-ack
       D                   Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D                   Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D                   Em      C   G
I think I'd have a heart atta-a-a-a-a-ack
       D                      Em
I think I'd have a heart attack
