[Verse 1]
Bb                D#
This is the air I breathe
Bb                D#
This is the air I breathe
Bb           Gm              F
Your holy presence living in me

[Verse 2]
Bb         D#
This is my daily bread
Bb         D#
This is my daily bread
Bb          Gm           F
Your very word spoken to me

[Chorus]
Bb    F               D#     
And I'm desperate for you
Bb    F               D# 
And I'm lost without you
