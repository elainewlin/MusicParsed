[Verse 1]
A#                D#
This is the air I breathe
A#                D#
This is the air I breathe
A#           Gm              F
Your holy presence living in me

[Verse 2]
A#         D#
This is my daily bread
A#         D#
This is my daily bread
A#          Gm           F
Your very word spoken to me

[Chorus]
A#    F               D#     
And I'm desperate for you
A#    F               D# 
And I'm lost without you
