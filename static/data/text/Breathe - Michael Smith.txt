[Verse 1]
Bb                Eb
This is the air I breathe
Bb                Eb
This is the air I breathe
Bb           Gm              F
Your holy presence living in me

Bb         Eb
This is my daily bread
Bb         Eb
This is my daily bread
Bb          Gm           F
Your very word spoken to me

[Chorus]
Bb    F               Eb     
And I'm desperate for you
Bb    F               Eb 
And I'm lost without you
