[Verse 1]

Em    Bm 
Oh, no
Am               C                 Em      Bm
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Am         C                    Em         Bm
Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?
Am              C                  Em    Bm   Am   C
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe,   ah


[Pre-Chorus]

Em                 Bm                       Am                C
 Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
Em             Bm                   Am                     C
 You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Em                  Bm                Am             C
 You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
Em                   Bm               Am                
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously


[Chorus]

Em          Bm   Am
Talk to me, baby
    C                Em               Bm            Am  
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
      C                  Em         Bm    Am
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
  C       Em        Bm                Am          C
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Em          Bm   Am
Walk for me, baby
C               Em        Bm          Am  
I'll be Diddy,  you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
      C                  Em         Bm    Am
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy

I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean



[Verse 2]

Em    Bm
God damn
Am               C                 Em      Bm
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Am           C                   Em      Bm
Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
    Am                C            Em      Bm    Am   C
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh


[Pre-Chorus]

Em                 Bm                       Am                C
 Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
Em             Bm                   Am                     C
 You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Em                  Bm                Am             C
 You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
Em                   Bm               Am
