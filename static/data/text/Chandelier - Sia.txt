[Verse]

Am
Party girls don't get hurt
F
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
G                        Em 
I push it down, push it do--own

Am
I'm the one "for a good time call"
        F
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
  G                        Em
I feel the love, feel the lo--ove


[Pre-Chorus]

F
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
Am
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
G
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
G
Throw em back, till I lose count


[Chorus]

F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
F         G                  C                      F
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
F         G          C                               F
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier


[Bridge]

                F                                       G
And I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
                     C                                          F
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
                     F                                       G
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
                     C                                          F    
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
F
On for tonight


[Verse]

Am
Sun is up, I'm a mess
      F
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
     G                                 Em
Here comes the shame, here comes the sha--ame


[Pre-Chorus]

F
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
Am
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
G
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
G
Throw em back, till I lose count


[Chorus]

F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
F         G                  C                      F
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
F         G          C                               F
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

F                    G

Oh I'm just holdin' on for tonight

On for tonight
F
On for tonight
