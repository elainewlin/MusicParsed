Who shot that arrow in your throat?
F                 E
Who missed the crimson apple?
Am                    F               E
It hung heavy on the tree above your head.
Am                      F               E
This chaos, this calamity, this garden once was perfect.
Am                            F           E
Give your immortality to me, I’ll set you up against the stars.
Am                     F        E
Glor-or-or-ri-uh, we lied, we can’t go on.
Am                                        F     E
This is the time and this is the place to be alive.
Am
Who shot that arrow in your throat?
F                 E
Who missed the crimson apple?
Am                             F       E
And there’s a discord in the garden tonight.
F               C                 G
The sea’s wine red, this is the death of beauty.
F                C                  G
The doves have died, the lovers have lied.
Am                          F                    E
I cut the arrow from your neck, stretched you beneath the trees
Am                         F              E
Among the roots and baby breath I covered us with silver leaves.
Am                     F        E
Glor-or-or-ri-uh, we lied, we can’t go on.
Am                                        F     E
This is the time and this is the place to be alive.
F               C                 G
The sea’s wine red, this is the death of beauty.
F                C                  G
The doves have died, the lovers have lied.
