[Verse]
    Fm                      Db
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      Eb              Bbsus4  Bbm
Not a footprint to be seen
  Fm            Db
A kingdom of isolation
       Eb                  Bbsus4  Bb  Fm
And it looks like I'm the queen
              Db                 Eb             Bbsus4  Bbm
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Fm               Eb                     Bb
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
[Pre-Chorus]
Eb                                 Db
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    Eb
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    Db
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
      Db
Well, now they know
[Chorus]
        Ab         Ebsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             Dbadd9
Can't hold it back anymore
        Ab         Ebsus4
Let it go, let it go
       Fm7               Dbadd9
Turn away and slam the door
Ab       Ebsus4           Fm7       Dbadd9
I don't care what they're going to say
        Cm7         Cb
Let the storm rage on
    Db
The cold never bothered me anyway
[Instrumental]
Ab   Ebsus4
[Verse]
Fm                   Db            Eb               Bbm
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        Fm                  Eb              Bbsus4        Bb
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
[Pre-Chorus]
Eb                           Dbadd9
It's time to see what I can do
                              Eb
To test the limits and break through
                                  Dbadd9
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    Db
I'm free...
[Chorus]
        Ab         Ebsus4
Let it go, let it go
     Fm7                    Dbadd9
I am one with the wind and sky
        Ab         Ebsus4
Let it go, let it go
       Fm7           Dbadd9
You'll never see me cry
Ab      Ebsus4   Fm7        Dbadd9
Here I stand and here I'll stay
        Cm7         Cb  Db
Let the storm rage on
[Bridge]
Db
My power flurries through the air into the ground
Db
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
Eb
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Fm         Db             Eb              Bbm  Db
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
[Chorus]
        Ab         Ebsus4
Let it go, let it go
          Fm7                    Dbadd9
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
        Ab         Ebsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             Dbadd9
That perfect girl is gone
Ab      Ebsus4      Fm7       Dbadd9  Dbm
Here I stand in the light of day
        Cm7         Cb
Let the storm rage on
    Db
The cold never bothered me anyway
