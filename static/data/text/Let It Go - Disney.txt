[Verse]
    Em                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D               Asus4   Am
Not a footprint to be seen
  Em            C
A kingdom of isolation
       D                  Asus4    A
And it looks like I'm the queen
              Em          C                 D              Asus4    Am
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Em               D                     A
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

[Pre-Chorus]
D                                 C
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    D
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    C
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
               C
Well, now they know

[Chorus]
       G          Dsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Em7             Cadd9
Can't hold it back anymore
          G          Dsus4
Let it go, let it go 
      Em7              Cadd9
Turn away and slam the door
G       Dsus4          Em7      Cadd9
I don't care what they're going to say
        Bm7         Bb
Let the storm rage on
    C
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Instrumental]
G   Dsus4

[Verse]
   Em                    C              D               Am
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        Em              D                   Asus4         A
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

[Pre-Chorus]
D                            Cadd9
It's time to see what I can do
                             D  
To test the limits and break through
                                 Cadd9
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    C
I'm free...                                

[Chorus]
       G          Dsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Em7             Cadd9
I am one with the wind and sky
          G          Dsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Em7              Cadd9
You'll never see me cry
G       Dsus4          Em7      Cadd9
Here I stand and here I'll stay
        Bm7         Bb      C
Let the storm rage on

[Bridge]
C
My power flurries through the air into the ground
C
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Em        C              D               Am     C
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

[Chorus]
       G          Dsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Em7             Cadd9
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
          G          Dsus4
Let it go, let it go
      Em7              Cadd9
That perfect girl is gone
G      Dsus4     Em7      Cadd9    Cm
Here I stand in the light of day
        Bm7         Bb      C
Let the storm rage on
    C
The cold never bothered me anyway
