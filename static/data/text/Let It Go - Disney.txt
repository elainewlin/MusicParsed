[Verse]
    Fm                      C#
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D#               A#sus4   A#m
Not a footprint to be seen
  Fm            C#
A kingdom of isolation
       D#                  A#sus4    A#
And it looks like I'm the queen
              Fm          C#                 D#              A#sus4    A#m
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Fm               D#                     A#
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
[Pre-Chorus]
D#                                 C#
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    D#
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    C#
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
               C#
Well, now they know
[Chorus]
       G#          D#sus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             C#add9
Can't hold it back anymore
          G#          D#sus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7              C#add9
Turn away and slam the door
G#       D#sus4          Fm7      C#add9
I don't care what they're going to say
        Cm7         B
Let the storm rage on
    C#
The cold never bothered me anyway
[Instrumental]
G#   D#sus4
[Verse]
   Fm                    C#              D#               A#m
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        Fm              D#                   A#sus4         A#
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
[Pre-Chorus]
D#                            C#add9
It's time to see what I can do
                             D#
To test the limits and break through
                                 C#add9
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    C#
I'm free...
[Chorus]
       G#          D#sus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             C#add9
I am one with the wind and sky
          G#          D#sus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7              C#add9
You'll never see me cry
G#       D#sus4          Fm7      C#add9
Here I stand and here I'll stay
        Cm7         B      C#
Let the storm rage on
[Bridge]
C#
My power flurries through the air into the ground
C#
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D#
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Fm        C#              D#               A#m     C#
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
[Chorus]
       G#          D#sus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             C#add9
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
          G#          D#sus4
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7              C#add9
That perfect girl is gone
G#      D#sus4     Fm7      C#add9    C#m
Here I stand in the light of day
        Cm7         B      C#
Let the storm rage on
    C#
The cold never bothered me anyway
