The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
Bm                       Em                           G                      A
Me and my friends at the table doing shots, drinking fast and then we talk slow
     Bm                         Em                      G                        A
Come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Bm                      Em                      G                A
Take my hand, stop! Put Van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance and now I'm singing like


[PRE-CHORUS]

Bm               Em
Girl, you know I want your love
G                       A                Bm
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             Em
Come on now, follow my lead
G               A
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
Bm             Em
Boy, let's not talk too much
G                    A                Bm
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             Em
Come on now, follow my lead
  G                      N.C.
Come—come on now, follow my lead

  I'm in love with the shape of you
               A                 Bm
  We push and pull like a magnet do
              Em               G
  Although my heart is falling too
          A
  I'm in love with your body
Bm          Em                   G
  And last night you were in my room
             A                    Bm
  And now my bedsheets smell like you
                    Em                  G
  Every day discovering something brand new
               A
  Well I'm in love with your body
Bm Em G            A
(Oh I)      I'm in love with your body

Bm                    Em
One week in we let the story begin
            G                A
We're going out on our first date
            Bm                  Em
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
             G                   A
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            Bm                        Em
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             G                A
And how your family is doin' okay
              Bm                Em
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
          G                     A
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
