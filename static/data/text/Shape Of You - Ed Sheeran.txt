C#m                      F#m                          A             B
The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
C#m                      F#m                          A                      B
Me and my friends at the table doing shots, drinking fast and then we talk slow
     C#m                        F#m                     A                        B
Come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I'll give it a chance now
        C#m                     F#m                     A                B     
Take my hand, stop! Put Van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance and now I'm singing like

[PRE-CHORUS]
C#m              F#m
Girl, you know I want your love
A                       B                C#m
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A               B    
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
C#m            F#m
Boy, let's not talk too much
A                    B                C#m
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
  A                      N.C.
Come—come on now, follow my lead

  I'm in love with the shape of you
               B                 C#m 
  We push and pull like a magnet do
              F#m              A
  Although my heart is falling too
          B 
  I'm in love with your body
C#m         F#m                  A
  And last night you were in my room
             B                    C#m
  And now my bedsheets smell like you
                    F#m                 A
  Every day discovering something brand new
               B
  Well I'm in love with your body

C#m                   F#m
One week in we let the story begin
            A                B
We're going out on our first date
            C#m                 F#m
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
             A                   B
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            C#m                       F#m
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             A                B
And how your family is doin' okay
              C#m               F#m
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
          A                     B
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
