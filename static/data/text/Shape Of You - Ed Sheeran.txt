[Intro x2] 
C#m F#m A B
 
[Verse]
    C#m                 F#m
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
       A              B
So the bar is where I go
C#m                      F#m
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
         A               B
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
     C#m                       F#m
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    A                       B
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        C#m                    F#m
Took my hand, stop, prepare "The man" on the jukebox
    A                B
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C#m              F#m
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 C#m
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A               B    
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
C#m              F#m
Boy, let's not talk too much
A                    B                C#m
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A
Come—come on now, follow my lead
 
[Chorus]
C#m      F#m                    A
  I'm in love with the shape of you
            B                  C#m
We push and pull like a magnet do
            F#m              A
Although my heart is falling too
       B 
I'm in love with your body
C#m        F#m                  A
  And last night you were in my room
           B                    C#m
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                 F#m                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
            B
Well I'm in love with your body
C#m F#m A         B
           I'm in love with your body
C#m F#m A         B
           I'm in love with your body
C#m F#m A         B
           I'm in love with your body
C#m               F#m                  A
 Every day discovering something brand new
       B
I'm in love with the shape of you
 
[Verse]
C#m                    F#m
One week in we let the story begin
            A                B
We're going out on our first date
            C#m                  F#m
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
             A                   B
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            C#m                       F#m
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             A                B
And how your family is doin' okay
              C#m               F#m
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
         A                     B
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
 
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] 
 
[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

C#m            F#m 
  Come on, be my baby, come on
A                B
  Come on, be my baby, come on
C#m            F#m 
  Come on, be my baby, come on
A                B
  Come on, be my baby, come on
 
[Chorus]
C#m      F#m                    A
  I'm in love with the shape of you
            B                  C#m
We push and pull like a magnet do
            F#m              A
Although my heart is falling too
       B 
I'm in love with your body
C#m        F#m                  A
  And last night you were in my room
           B                    C#m
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                 F#m                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
            B
Well I'm in love with your body
C#m            F#m 
  Come on, be my baby, come on
A                B
  Come on, be my baby, come on
C#m            F#m 
  Come on, be my baby, come on
A                B
  Come on, be my baby, come on
C#m            F#m 
  Come on, be my baby, come on
A                B
  Come on, be my baby, come on
C#m               F#m                  A
 Every day discovering something brand new
       B
I'm in love with the shape of you
