[Verse 1]

Em        D       G
Let's get down to business
   Am          D
To de-feat the Huns
Em       D       G
Did they send me daughters
       Am        D
When I asked for sons?


[Chorus]

           C               D
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
            G                C
But you can bet before we're through
        C           D           Em      
Mister, I'll make a man out of you


[Verse 2]

Em       D    G
Tranquil as a forest
       Am       D
But on fire within
Em       D         G
Once you find your center
        Am      D
you are sure to win


[Chorus]

         C               D
You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot
        G             C
And you haven't got a clue
        C           D          Em    
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

C               D
I'm never gonna catch my breath
B                         Em 
Say good-bye to those who knew me
D                    G                  C
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
C                  D
This guy's got 'em scared to death
B                         Em
Hope he doesn't see right through me
D                      G             C
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim


[Chorus 2]

C                     D            B        Em 
(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing ri-ver
C                       D          B        Em
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
C                       D             B     Em
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
C                 D                Em
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon


[Verse 3]

Fm       Eb      Ab
Time is racing toward us
         Bbm  Eb
till the Huns arrive
Fm      Eb   Ab
Heed my every order
        Bbm       Eb
and you might survive


[Chorus 3]

       Db                Eb
You're unsuited for the rage of war
        Ab                 Db
So pack up, go home you're through
                   Eb         Fm    
How could I make a man out of you?


[Chorus 2]

Db                     Eb          C        Fm 
(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing ri-ver
Db                      Eb         C        Fm
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
Db                      Eb            C     Fm
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
Db                 Eb              Fm  
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
