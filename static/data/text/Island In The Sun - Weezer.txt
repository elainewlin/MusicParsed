Em  Am             D     G   Em  Am
       When you're on a holiday
           D        G        Em  Am
You can't find the words to say
          D          G       Em  Am
All the things that come to you
       D      G      Em  Am
And I wanna feel it too

[Chorus]
      D      G       Em  Am
On an island in the sun
           D          G      Em  Am
We'll be playing and having fun
        D        G       Em
And it makes me feel so fine
   Am        D       G
I can't control my brain

Em  Am             D     G      Em  Am
       When you're on a golden sea
           D       G   Em  Am
You don't need no memory
         D      G          Em  Am
Just a place to call your own
        D      G      Em  Am
As we drift into the zone

[Chorus]
      D      G       Em  Am
On an island in the sun

We'll be playing and having fun
        D        G       Em
And it makes me feel so fine
   Am        D       G
I can't control my brain

[Bridge]
D            G
 We'll run away together
D                  G
 We'll spend some time forever
C             Am          D
 We'll never feel bad anymore (Hip hip)
