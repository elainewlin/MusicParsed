CAPO 1
[Verse 1]
Dm7      Fsus2
Found you when your heart was broke
C                    Bb
 I filled your cup until it overflowed
        Dm    Fsus2
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
C                Gm7
 I was afraid to leave you on your own


[Pre-Chorus]
           Dm7                  Fsus2
I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
            C                       Bb
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
           Dm7
And then I got you off your knees
Fsus2
Put you right back on your feet
        C                           Gm7
Just so you could take advantage of me


[Chorus]
                  Dm7          Fsus2
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
           C                  Bb
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
                 Dm7             Fsus2
You know I'm the one who put you up there
            C                 Gm7
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
                   Dm7  Fsus2
Thinking you could live without me
                   C    Bb
Thinking you could live without me
              Dm7             Fsus2
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
             C                  Gm7
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
                   Dm7  Fsus2
Thinking you could live without me
C    Bb
Live without me
              Dm7             Fsus2
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
             C            Gm7
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)


[Verse 2]
Dm7      Fsus2
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
C                     Bb
Just running from the demons in your mind
       Dm7       Fsus2
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)
C                Gm7
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind


[Pre-Chorus]
           Dm7                  Fsus2
I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
            C                       Bb
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
           Dm7
And then I got you off your knees
Fsus2
Put you right back on your feet
        C                           Gm7
Just so you could take advantage of me


[Chorus]
                  Dm7          Fsus2
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
           C                  Bb
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
                 Dm7             Fsus2
You know I'm the one who put you up there
            C                 Gm7
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
                   Dm7  Fsus2
Thinking you could live without me
                   C    Bb
Thinking you could live without me
              Dm7             Fsus2
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
             C                  Gm7
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
                   Dm7  Fsus2
Thinking you could live without me
C    Bb
Live without me
              Dm7             Fsus2
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
             C            Gm7
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)


[Bridge]
Dm7                  Fsus2
You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
  C                     Bb
I already know (I know)
                              Dm7    Fsus2
I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)
                     C        Gm7
So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)


[Chorus]
                  Dm7          Fsus2
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
           C                  Bb
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
                 Dm7             Fsus2
You know I'm the one who put you up there
            C                 Gm7
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
                   Dm7  Fsus2
Thinking you could live without me
                   C    Bb
Thinking you could live without me
              Dm7             Fsus2
