[Intro]
                                 Am7
Well can't you see that it's just raining?
                       G7
Ain't no need to go outside.
      D7
But baby!

[Verse]

    G           D7
You hardly even notice
Am7           C7 
when I try to show you
     G                D7
This song is meant to keep you
     Am7               C7
from doing what you're supposed to
G             D7
wakin' up too early
Am7            C7
maybe we could sleep in
G               D7
make you banana pancakes
Am7                  C7
pretend like it's the weekend


[Chorus]

Am7
now
                            G  
we could pretend it all the time.
                             Am7
Can't you see that it's just raining.
                       G 
Ain't no need to go outside.
         D7
But just maybe


[Verse]

G          D7    Am7         C7 
Hala ka ukulele, mama made a baby.
G                     D7             Am7              C7 
Really don't mind the practice cause you're my little lady.
G         D7              Am7              C7 
Lady lady love me cause I love to lay here lazy.
G                  D7         Am7                   C7 
We could close the curtains pretend like there's no world


[Chorus]

Am7
outside.
                             G   
 we could pretend it all the time.
                             Am7
Can't you see that it's just raining.
                       G 
Ain't no need to go outside.

                       Am7
Ain't no need ain't no need.
    G
mmm-mmm
                        Am7
Can't you see can't you see?
                           G
Rain all day and I don't mind.


[Bridge]

Am7                                                            
But the telephone is singin' ringin' 
                            D
it's too early dont pick it up.
We don't need to
       Am7                                         
we got everything we need right here and 
                      D
everything we need is enough.
just so easy
         Bm7
When the whole world fit's inside of your arms
      Em             Em/D#         C
do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
        G          D7
wake up slow,  mmm mmm
        G
wake up slow


[Verse]

G   D7  
But baby!
    G           D7
You hardly even notice
Am7           C7 
when I try to show you
     G                D7
This song is meant to keep you
     Am7               C7
from doing what you're supposed to


G             D7
wakin' up too early
Am7            C7
maybe we could sleep in
G               D7
make you banana pancakes
Am7                  C7
pretend like it's the weekend


[Chorus]
Am7
now.
                            G  
We could pretend it all the time.
                             Am7
Can't you see that it's just raining.
                       G 
Ain't no need to go outside.
                       Am7
ain't no need ain't no need.
                   G
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind.
                         Am7
Can't you see can't you see?
                   G
you gotta wake up slow.
