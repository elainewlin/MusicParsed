C                                     D7
I see you driving round town with the girl I love
             F            C
And I'm like "Forget you!"  Ooo ooo ooo
C                               D7
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
              F             C
And I'm like "Forget you, and forget her too."
C                    D7
If I was richer, I'd still be with ya
F                         C
Now ain't that something (Ain't that something)
C                                           D7
And though there's pain in my chest I still wish you the best
       F            C
With a "Forget you"

C                                      D7
I said I'm sorry...I can't afford a Ferrari
    F                                    C
But that don't mean I can't get you there
C                                   D7
I guess he's an Xbox...and I'm more Atari
        F                            C
But the way you play your game ain't fair


[Chorus]

C                        D7
I pity the foooooool who falls in love with you
   F                         C
Oh she's a gold digger, just thought you should know
C            D7
Ooooooooo, I got some news for you
F                                      C
You can go run and tell your boyfriend

C                   D7      F
Now I know I had to borrow, beg and steal and lie and cheat
C                           D7
Tryin to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
      F                                 C
Cause being in love with your ain't cheap

Ooh, I really hate you right now
