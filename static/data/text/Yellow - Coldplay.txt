Look at the stars
                       F#
Look how they shine for you

And everything you do,

Yeah, they were all yellow.

I came along,
                  F#
I wrote a song for you
                          E
And all the things you do,

And it was called "Yellow."

So then i took my turn,
                            E
Oh what a thing to have done,
                       B
And it was all yellow.

E
Your Skin,
G#m       F#
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
E    G#m        F#
Turn into something beautiful,
E        G#m        F#
You know, you know I love you so,
E
You know i love you so.

I swam across,
                   F#
I jumped across for you,
                      E
Oh, what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow.
B                F#
I drew a line,
                F#
I drew a line for you,
                      E
Oh, what a thing to do
                      B
And it was all yellow.

E
Your Skin,

Oh yeah, your skin and bones
E    G#m        F#
Turn into something beautiful,
E
And you know,

For you I bleed myself dry,

For you I bleed myself dry.
