C         Em
Somewhere over the rainbow,
F         C
way up high
F         C
Thereâ€™s a place that I heard of
G              Am  F
once in a lullaby
C         Em
Somewhere over the rainbow,
F             C
blue birds fly

F       C
And the dreams that you dream of,
G                     Am   F
dreams really do come true
C
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G                                  Am           F
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

C         Em
Somewhere over the rainbow,
F             C
blue birds fly
F       C
And the dreams that you dare to,
G                 Am F C
why, oh why can't I?
