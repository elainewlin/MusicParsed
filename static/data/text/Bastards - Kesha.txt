[Intro]
One, two, three, four, one

[Verse 1]
               G     C                    G
I got too many people I got left to prove wrong
G                       C                           G
All those motherfuckers, have been too mean for too long
G                       C
And I'm so sick of crying
C                  G
Darling, what’s it for?
G                         C
I could fight forever, oh
C              G
But life's too short


[Chorus]
                               D        C
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
C                               G   C G
Don’t let the assholes wear you out
G                                 D
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
D                                C
Don't let the scumbags screw you around
C                               G    C G
Don't let the bastards take you down


[Verse 2]
G                  C          G
Been underestimated my entire life
G                            C
I know people gonna talk shit
C                   G
And darling, that's fine
G                           C                   G
But they won't break my spirit, I won't let 'em win
G                                         C
I’ll just keep on living, keep on living, oh
C               G
The way I wanna live


[Chorus]
                               D        C
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
C                               G   C G
Don’t let the assholes wear you out
G                                 D
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
D                                C
Don't let the scumbags screw you around
C                               G    C G
Don't let the bastards take you down
G                              D        C
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
C                               G   C G
Don’t let the assholes wear you out
G                                 D
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
D                                C
Don't let the scumbags screw you around
C                               G    C G
Don't let the bastards take you down
G     D                     C       G
Na na na, la la la la la la da, runaway, runaway
G     D                     C       G
Na na na, la la la la la la da, runaway, runaway
G     D                     C       G
Na na na, la la la la la la da, runaway, runaway
G     D                     C       G
Na na na, la la la la la la da, runaway, runaway
