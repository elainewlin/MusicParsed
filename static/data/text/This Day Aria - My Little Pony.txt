C#         Bm7
This day is going to be perfect
C#         B/D#
The kind of day of which I dreamed since I was small
Bm         F#
Everypony will gather round
Bm         F#
Say I look lovely in my gown
Am         C#m
What they don't know is that I have fooled them all

C#         Bm7
This day was going to be perfect
C#         B/D#
The kind of day of which I dreamed since I was small
Bm         F#
But instead of having cake
Bm         F#
With all my friends to celebrate
Am         C#
My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at all

G#
I could care less about the dress
C#m
I won't partake in any cake
F#m         C#m 
Vows, well I'll be lying when I say
G#
That through any kind of weather
C#m
I'll want us to be together
F#m         G#
The truth is I don't care for him at all
C#m         G#
No I do not love the groom
F#m         G#
In my heart there is no room 
A         G#                 C#m
But I still want him to be all mine

G#
We must escape before it's too late
C#m
Find a way to save the day
F#m         C#m 
Hope, I'll be lying if I say
G#
I don't fear that I may lose him
C#m
To one who wants to use him
F#m         G# 
Not care for, love and cherish him each day 
C#         G#
For I oh-so love the groom
A#m7         Fm
All my thoughts he does consume
D#m7         A#m         F#m         C#
Oh Shining Armor, I'll be there very soon

C#         Bm7 
Finally the moment has arrived
C#         B/D#
For me to be one lucky bride

Bm         F#
Oh, the wedding we won't make
Bm         Em7
He'll end up marrying a fake
Bm         F#
Shining Armor will be

Bm
Mine, all mine
