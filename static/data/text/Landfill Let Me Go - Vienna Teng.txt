F#m                 D
Call out what we’ve become
    F#m                Bm
The news has turned to numb
          Em
Locked in nearsight
       Em7
On the latest device
        G              A
Let the yet-to-be pick up the tab
       Em
Say we can’t escape
               Em7
Though there’s plenty of space
        G                     A
Barring holding on to what we used to have

G
In your head, where we’re headed
          D             A
You gotta let it on by, let me go
           G            
And get it in your head, where we’re headed
          D               A
You gotta let it all die, let me go

       Bm   G  F#m   A   Bm       D
'Cause this is torturous electricity
        G       A      Bm   G
Between both of us and this is
D     A                 Bm     D
Dangerous 'cause I want you so much
      G         A
But I hate your guts, I hate you

Bm                 D
So leave me in the cold
G              A
Wait until the snow covers me up
Bm          D
So I cannot move
G             A
So I'm just embedded in the frost
Bm                   D
Then leave me in the rain
G             A
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Bm             D
Wipe away your tear stains
G                                A
Thought you said you didn't feel pain

G
In your head, where we’re headed
          D             A
You gotta let it on by, let me go
           G            
And get it in your head, where we’re headed
          D               A
You gotta let it all die, let me go

Bm         
Gone, it’s gone
     G             A
Gave in again, now let me go
Bm         
Gone, it’s gone
     G             A
Gave in again, now let me go
