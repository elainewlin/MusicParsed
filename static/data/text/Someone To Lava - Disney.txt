Verse:
C                    G7   
A long long time ago, there was a volcano.
F                        C             G7
Living all alone, in the middle of the sea.
C                          G7
He sat high above his bay, watching all the couples play,
F                 C              G7
and wishing that, he had someone too.
C                            G7                            F
And from his lava came, this song of hope that he sang out-loud everyday,
C             G7
for years and years.
 
Chorus:
F                 C
I have a dream, I hope will come true,
     G7                      C
that you're here with me and I’m here with you
F                               C
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
     F       G7         C
will send me someone to la-va
 
Verse:
C                         G7
He was singing all alone, turned his lava into stone,
F                   C                G7
until he was on the brink of extinction.
C                           G7
But little did he know that living in the sea below
F                   C                G7
another volcano was listening to his song.
 
Verse:
C                                 G7
Every day she heard his tune, her lava grew and grew
F                        C                  G7
because she believed his song was meant for her.
C                       G7
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
F                      C                 G7
as he sang his song of hope for the last time.
 
Chorus:
F                 C
I have a dream, I hope will come true,
     G7                      C
that you're here with me and I’m here with you
F                               C
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
     F       G7         C
will send me someone to la-va
 
Verse:
C                         G7
Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano 
F                      C                 G7
looking all around but she could not see him.
C                                     G7
He tried to sing to let her know that she was not alone,
    F                G7           C
but with no lava his song was all done.
 
Verse:
C                                G7
He filled the sea with his tears watching his dreams disappear 
F                          C             G7
as she remembered what his song meant to her.
C                            G7
And oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea
    F                      G7            C
and all together now their lava grew and grew.
 
Verse:
C                              G7
No longer were they alone with Hawaii as their new home
    F                    C                 G7
and when you visit them, this is what they sing
 
Chorus:
F                 C
I have a dream, I hope will come true,
     G7                      C
that you're here with me and I’m here with you
F                               C
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
     F       G7         C
will send me someone to la-va
