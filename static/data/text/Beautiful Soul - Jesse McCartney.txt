[Intro]
A  E  F#m  D


[Chorus]

A         E       F#m          D
I don't want another pretty face
A         E       F#m          D
I don't want just anyone to hold
A          E        F#m           D
I don't want my love to go to waste
A          E        F#m          D
I want you and your beautiful soul
A         E       F#m        D
You're the one I want to chase
A         E       F#m      D
You're the one I want to hold
A          E         F#m             D
I won't let another minute go to waste
A          E        F#m         D
I want you and your beautiful soul


[Verse]

A         E      F#m               D
I know that you are something special
A         E      F#m        D
To you I'd be always faithful
A         E      F#m              D
I want to be what you always needed
A         E      F#m                 D
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me


[Chorus]
A         E       F#m          D
I don't want another pretty face
A         E       F#m          D
I don't want just anyone to hold
A          E        F#m           D
I don't want my love to go to waste
A          E        F#m          D
I want you and your beautiful soul
A         E       F#m        D
You're the one I want to chase
A         E       F#m      D
You're the one I want to hold
A          E         F#m             D

Your beautiful soul, yeah


[Verse]
A         E      F#m               D
You might need time to think it over
A       E      F#m             D
But I'm just fine moving forward
A   E     F#m    D
I'll ease your mind
A     E       F#m      D
If you give me the chance
A          E          F#m               D
I will never make you cry, c'mon let's try



[Chorus]
A         E       F#m          D

A         E       F#m          D
I don't want just anyone to hold
A          E        F#m           D

Am I crazy for wanting you
F#m                 E                D
Baby do you think you could want me too
F#m         E        D
I don't waste your time
F#m             E          D
Do you see things the way I do
F#m                 E                D
I just want to know that you feel it too
There is nothing left to hide
