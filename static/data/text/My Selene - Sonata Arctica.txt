[Verse 1]

Bm         G
Nocturnal poetry
        Em             A                      Bm
Dressed in the whitest silver, you'd smile at me
               G                   A
Every night I wait for my sweet Selene
F#m
But, still...
[Verse 2]

Bm           G
Solitude's upon my skin
   Em                        A           Bm
A life that's bound by the chains of reality
                 G             A
Would you let me be your Endymion?
[Pre-Chorus]

        Em            F#m            G           A
I would bathe in your moonlight and slumber in peace
       Em    F#m          G         A
Enchanted by your kiss in forever sleep
[Chorus]

    Bm        D       A             Bm
But until we unite I live for that night
Em       F#m   G           A
Wait for time Two souls entwine
       Bm            D      A          Bm
In the break of new dawn My hope is forlorn
  Em               F#m          G              A
Shadows, they will fade but I'm always in the shade
         Bm
Without you...
[Verse 3]

Bm          G
Serene and silent sky
Em                A                Bm
Rays of moon are dancing with the tide
           G                A
A perfect sight, a world divine
[Verse 4]

F#m      Bm             G
And I... the loneliest child alive
Em                A               Bm
Always waiting, searching for my rhyme
            G                   A
I'm still alone in the dead of night
[Pre-Chorus]

Em       F#m       G        A
Silent I lie with smile on my face,
Em         F#m                     G          A
Appearance deceives and the silence betrays
[Chorus]

      Bm          D        A           Bm
As I wait for the time My dream comes alive
Em            F#m        G            A
Always out of sight But never out of mind
    Bm           D     A               Bm
And under waning moon Still I long for you
  Em               F#m  G           A  Bm
Alone against the light Solitude am I
[C-Part]

       G           F#m           Bm
In the end, I'm enslaved by my dream
       G               F#m                  Bm
In the end, there's no soul who'd bleed for me
[Guitar Solo Base]

C A Dm Dm
[D-Part]

F#m
Hidden from daylight I'm sealed in my cave
                                               D
Trapped in a dream that is slowly turning to a nightmare
E
Venial is life when you're but a dream
                                              F#m
The book is still open, the pages as empty as me...
[Keyboard Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]

Em           F#m           G         A
I cling to a hope that's beginning to fade,
Em         F#m                  G        A
Trying to break the desolation I hate
[Chorus]

    Bm         D      A             Bm
But until we unite I live for that night
Em       F#m   G           A
Wait for time two souls entwine
        Bm           D        A         Bm
In the break of new dawn My hope is forlorn
Em             F#m       G          A
We will never meet only Misery and me
[Chorus steps up]

        Dm        F   C      Dm
This is my final call My evenfall
Gm             Am  Bb            C
Drowning into time I become the night
        Dm          F   C          Dm
By the light of new day I'll fade away
