[Verse 1]

E♭         B♭         Gm    F
I want to shrink so small
     E♭
Will that make me pretty?

Will that make me happy?
E♭        B♭        Gm    F
I always think so much
E♭
How the world sees me
B♭                 Gm F
Just fat and ugly
[Pre-Chorus x2]
      E♭sus2                B♭
Don't got a flat stomach or slim slim thighs
    Gm           F
Why do they only love one size?
[Chorus]

        Gm
And say thin is pretty and
F
Pretty is good
E♭
They'll make me pretty
B♭
They'll make me happy
         Gm
They say thin is pretty and
F
Pretty is good
E♭
They'll make me pretty
B♭
They'll make me happy
Gm F E♭ B♭

Every day, I say that I'm enough
F            E♭              B♭
It's okay, I know that I'm enough

Even though they say thin is pretty and
F
Pretty is good
        E♭
I don't need to be pretty
   B♭
So I can be happy
