[Intro x2]

C   D   Em 


[Verse]

C                D            Em
 Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call I'm angry
          C                  D
call I'm desperate for your voice
      Em                          C
listening to the song we used to sing
        D             Em
In the car, do you remember
                    C
Butterfly, Early Summer
        D         Em                           C
It's playing on repeat, Just like when we would meet
                D   Em
Like when we would meet


[Chorus]

      G   D               Em      C
I was born to tell you I love you
         G   D              Em          C
and I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine
  C 
Stay with me tonight


[Verse 2]

C                 D           Em
 Stripped and pollished, I am new, I am fresh
        C          D               Em
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
                C                   D
Because every breath that you will take
                Em
while you are sitting next to me
             C             D           Em
will bring life into my deepest hopes, What's your fantasy?
         C               D           Em
What's your....(What's your, What's your..) What's your..


[Chorus]

      G   D               Em      C
I was born to tell you I love you
         G   D              Em          C
and I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine
 C 
Stay with me tonight


[Breakdown]

Em   D   C   D
           
       D               C
And I'm tired of being all alone, and this solitary moment makes me want to
           D
come back home 
       D               C
And I'm tired of being all alone, and this solitary moment makes me want to
           D
come back home 
       D               C
And I'm tired of being all alone, and this solitary moment makes me want to
           D
come back home  (I know everything you wanted isn't anything you have)
       D               C
And I'm tired of being all alone, and this solitary moment makes me want to
           D
come back home  (I know everything you wanted isn't anything you have) 


[Chorus]

      G   D               Em      C
I was born to tell you I love you
         G   D              Em     C
and I am torn to do what I have to
      G   D               Em      C
I was born to tell you I love you
         G   D              Em
and I am torn to do what I have to   

      G   D               Em      C
I was born to tell you I love you   (I know everything you wanted isn't anything you have)
         G   D              Em     C
and I am torn to do what I have to  (I know everything you wanted isn't anything you have)
      G   D               Em      C
I was born to tell you I love you   (I know everything you wanted isn't anything you have)
         G   D              Em
and I am torn to do what I have to  (I know everything you wanted isn't anything you have) 
    C              C                 C 
To make you mine, Stay with me tonight...
