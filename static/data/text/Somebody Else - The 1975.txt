[Verse 1]

     F         G          Am7
So I heard you found somebody else
       F         G              Am7
and at first I thought it was a lie
                  F               G
I took all of my things that make sounds
    E7             Am7      
the rest I can do without


[Chorus]

F                             Am                               G
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
F                               Am                              G
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
F                                                           Am                            G
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone and then leaving with somebody else
F                                   Am                           G
oh, I don't want your body but I'm picturing your body with somebody else

F                                 Am              G
Come on baby, this ain't the last time that I'll see your face
F                                 Am           G
Come on baby, you said you'd find someone to take my place
F                                                                              G
Oh I just don't believe that you have got it in you cos we are just gonna keep 'doin it'
F                                                              G                          Am
and everytime I start to believe in anything you're saying I'm reminded that I should be getting over it

F                             Am                               G
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
F                               Am                              G
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
F                                                           Am                             G
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone and then leaving with somebody else
F                                   Am                           G
oh, I don't want your body but I'm picturing your body with somebody else


[Bridge] 

F                     G                     C
Get someone you love? Get someone you need? Fuck that, get money
F
I can't give you my soul, cos we're never alone


[Chorus]

F                             Am                               G
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
F                               Am                              G
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
F                                                           Am                             G
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone and then leaving with somebody else
F                                   Am                           G
oh, I don't want your body but I'm picturing your body with somebody else
