[Verse 1]

     F         G          C
So I heard you found somebody else
       F         G              Amadd9
and at first I thought it was a lie
                  F               G
I took all of my things that make sounds
    E7             Amadd9  Am/C Am
the rest I can do without

[Chorus]
F                                          Am                 G         Am
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
F                                                Am            G         Am
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
F
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
         Am               G         Am
and then leaving with somebody else
    F                                             Am            G         G
oh, I don't want your body but I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Verse]
        F                              Am        G
Come on baby, this ain't the last time that I'll see your face
        F                             Am     G
Come on baby, you said you'd find someone to take my place
    F                                         Am
Oh, I just don't believe that you have got it in you
      G
Cause we are just gonna keep 'doing it'
Am         F                                     Am
Every time I start to believe in anything you're saying
    G
I'm reminded that I should be getting over it


[Chorus]
F                                          Am                 G         Am
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
F                                                Am            G         Am
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
F
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
         Am               G         Am
and then leaving with somebody else
    F                                             Am            G         Am
