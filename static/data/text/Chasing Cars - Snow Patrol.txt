[Verse]
C               G      F            C
We'll do it all, everything, on our own.
C          G       F         C
We don't need anything, or anyone.


[Chorus]
    C                   G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
                F                           C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.


[Verse]
C              G          F            C
I don't quite know how to say how I feel
C               G              F              C
Those three words, I said too much, but not enough.


[Chorus]
C                       G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
           F                            C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.


[Bridge]
C                                       G
Forget what we're told, before we get too old
           F                            C
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.


[Verse]
C               G          F               C
Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads.
C               G          F              C
I need your grace to remind me, to find my own.


[Chorus]
C                       G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
                F                          C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.


[Bridge]
C                                       G
Forget what we're told, before we get too old
           F                            C
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.


[Verse]
C                       G
All that I am, all that I ever was
                        F                       C
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
C                                  G
I don't know where, confused about how as well
                        F                               C
just know that these things will never change for us at all.


[Chorus]
C                       G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
                F                       C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
