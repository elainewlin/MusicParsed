Two headed boy
    G           B
All floating in glass
    G          B
The sun it has passed
         C            G
Now it's blacker than black
      C                      D
I can hear as you tap on your jar
     C                           G
I am listening to hear where you are
     C                           G
I am listening to hear where you are

G              B
Put on sunday shoes
    G               B        C        G
And dance round the room to accordion keys
         C                         D
With the needle that sings in your heart
         C                         G
Catching signals that sound in the dark
         C                         G
Catching signals that sound in the dark
        D            C
We will take off our clothes
                       G
And they'll be placing fingers through
    D               C
the notches in your spine
                          G
And when all is breaking, everything

G          B
Two headed boy
     G           B
With pulleys and weights
   G      B        C              G
Creating a radio played just for two
       C                            D
In the parlor with a moon across her face
    C                            G
And through the music he sweetly displays
       C                        G
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
C            C
Made for his lover who's floating and

choking with her hands across her

And in the dark we will take off our clothes

And they'll be placing fingers through

There's no reason to grieve
    G              B                  C           G
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
     C                              D
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
           C                      G
And I will take you and leave you alone
         C                       G
Watching spirals of white softly flow
          C
Over your eyelids and all you did
                                       D
Will wait until the point when you let go
C                G
