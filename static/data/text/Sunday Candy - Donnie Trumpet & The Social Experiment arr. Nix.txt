[Verse 1]
        Fadd9            Fadd9   Aaug7        Faug  Dm
She can say in her voice, in her way that she loves me
Dm       G7sus2    Dm    Bb              
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, 
            Bb           F F Fsus4                         
with her hands, with her money
         C
I am the thesis of her prayers
    Fadd9                  Fadd9    Aaug7   Faug    Dm
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
                                Dm  G7sus2       Dm         Bb
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
  Bb                   F     F                Fsus4
I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma
                          C
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Fadd9         Fadd9 Aaug7    Faug  Dm
Mine's is handmade, pan-fried, sun-dried
                    Dm  G7sus2      Dm   Bb
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
                     Bb       F    F                    Fsus4
Praying with her hands tight, president of my fan club, Santa
                  C
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Chorus]
                  Fadd9
You gotta move it slowly
Aaug7           Faug           Dm
Take and eat my body like it's holy
G7sus2            Dm              Bb
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
F
I've been praying for you, 
          Fsus4  C
you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge]
Fadd9           Aaug7 Faug Faug Faug
Come on in this house, 
      Dm        G7sus2 Dm Dm Dm 
cause it's gonna rain
Bb        F     Fsus4      C
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
           Fadd9           Aaug7 Faug Faug Faug
You better come on in this house, 
      Dm        G7sus2 Dm Dm Dm 
cause it's gonna rain
Bb        F     Fsus4      C
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain

[Verse 2]
          Fadd9                      
I come to church for the candy, 
           Aaug7       Faug
your peppermint is the truth
         Dm                        G7sus2             Dm
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
            Bb                            F
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
         Fsus4                            C
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
          Fadd9                       Aaug7       Faug
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
      Dm                                G7sus2     Dm
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
          Bb                            F
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
               Fsus4                     C
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
               Fadd9                       Aaug7
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
                    Dm                     G7sus2
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
               Bb                        F
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
                     Fsus4
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute 
       C
let me take my butt to church

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]
