[Verse 1]
G
Now let me tell you a story
        C
'bout a man named Charlie
        G                D7
On this tragic & fateful day
       G
He put 10 cents into his pocket
            C
kissed his wife & family
        G           D7   G
Went to ride on the M.T.A.

[Chorus]
G
But did he ever return?
        C
No, he never returned,
         G                   D7
And his fate is still unlearned
        G
He may ride forever
            C
'neath the streets of Boston
         G       D7           G
He's the man who never returned

[Verse 2]
G
Charlie handed in his dime
        C
At the Kendall Square Station
             G              D7
And he changed for Jamaica Plain
        G
When he got there the conductor told him
 C
"One more nickel"
        G            D7         G
Charlie couldn't get off that train

[Verse 3]
     G
Now all night long Charlie
 C
rides thru the station
         G                   D7
Saying, "What will become of me?
        G                   C
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea
      G          D7   G
Or my cousin in Roxbury?"

[Verse 4]
G
Charlie's wife goes down to
C
Scollay Square Station
      G                     D7
Every day at a quarter past two
            G
And thu the open window
          C
she hands Charlie a sandwich
       G             D7      G
As the train comes rumblin' thru

[Verse 5]
G
Now you citizens of Boston,
            C
 don't you think it is a scandal
         G                    D7
That the people have to pay & pay
          G                       C
Fight the fare increase, vote for Walter O'Brien
        G               D7   G
And get Charlie off the M.T.A.!
