[Verse]
A
Give me something to believe
F#m
It's the only thing I need
D                E
It's true, true, true
E
You know I want to
A
Hang on every word you say
F#m
Wish there was something I could play
D             E
For you, you, you
E
You know I want to
A     F#m
Ou ou ou ou
D     E
Ou ou ou ou 
                   A
Oh you know I want to
F#m   D
Ou ou ou ou
E
Oh

[Chorus]
                   D        A
You know I want to make you mine
             D       A
I'm tired of wasting time
          D       A
I drive a million miles
          E
To get to you
          A       G
Because I want to

[Verse]
A
Wish I could see you every night
F#m
I'd kiss you and I'd hold you tight
D                E
It's true, true, true

You know I want to
A     F#m
Ou ou ou ou

Ou ou ou ou

Oh

[Chorus]
                   D        A
You know I want to make you mine
             D       A
I'm tired of wasting time
          D       A
I drive a million miles
          E
To get to you
          A       
Because I want to

[Bridge]
A/C#      D              A
I found a diamond in the rough
                     A/C#
Now I can never get enough
         D               A
Everyone seemed perfect before
                                  F#m
They left me wanting so much more
        E/G#            A
I don't care what they say

[Chorus x2]
                   D        A
You know I want to make you mine
             D       A
I'm tired of wasting time
          D       A
I drive a million miles
          E
To get to you
          A       
Because I want to

A     F#m
Ou ou ou ou
D     E
Ou ou ou ou
                   A
Oh you know I want to
F#m   D
Ou ou ou ou
E
Oh
          A       
Because I want you
