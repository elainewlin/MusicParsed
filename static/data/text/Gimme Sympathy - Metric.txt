[Verse]

      Bb                         F
Get hot Get too close to the flame

               Gm                              
Wild open space  
                  Eb   
Talk like an open book

        Bb       
Sign me up  
                       F
Got no time to take a picture

                 Gm    
I'll remember someday            

                    Eb
All the chances we took


[Pre-Chorus]

           Eb    
We're so close 

                           F
to something better left unknown

          Eb
We're so close 

                           F
to something better left unknown


[Chorus]

I can feel it in my bones

Eb
Gimme 

        Bb

Who would you

The Rolling Stones?

Eb
Oh 

        Bb

        F                         Eb
You're gonna make mistakes you're young

Come on baby 

        F

[Verse 2]

      Bb
Don't go

                     F
Stay with the all unknown
                  
                   Gm
Stay away from the hooks
                
                    Eb
All the chances we took


[Pre-Chorus]

          Eb                                  F
We're so close to something better left unknown

          Eb                                  F
We're so close to something better left unknown
