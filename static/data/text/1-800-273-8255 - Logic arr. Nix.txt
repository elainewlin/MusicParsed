Pick Bb C Dm F


[Pre-Chorus x2]
Pick Bb C Dm F
I been on the low
I been taking my time
Pick Bb C Dm F
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
              Dm   
I don't wanna be alive
Bbmaj7             Csus4
I don't wanna be alive
                       Fmaj7sus2
I just wanna die today
                 Dm
I just wanna die
                       Bbmaj7
I don't wanna be alive
                   Csus4
I don't wanna be alive
                 Fmaj7sus2
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1]
DDD UDU DD
Dm 
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
          Bbmaj7  
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
       Fadd9 
And my life don't even matter
                               Csus4
I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
              Dm 
I never had a place to call my own
              Bbmaj7 
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
          Fadd9
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
               Csus4
They say every life is precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus]
DUD DUD DUDU
Dm
I been on the low
                 Bbmaj7
I been taking my time
                          Fadd9
I feel like I'm out of my mind
                           Csus4
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
              Dm   
I want you to be alive
Bbmaj7             Csus4
I want you to be alive
                          Fmaj7sus2
You don't gotta die today
                    Dm
You don't gotta die
                       Bbmaj7  
I want you to be alive
                   Csus4
I want you to be alive
                    Fmaj7sus2
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2]
DUD DUD DUDU
Fadd9_1
It's the very first breath
                      C7sus4_1
When your head's been drowning underwater
    Fadd9_1
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
C7sus4_1
Chest to chest with a lover
     C7sus4_1
It's holding on, though the road's long
           Fadd9_1
And seeing light in the darkest things
             C7sus4_1
And when you stare at your reflection
                Fadd9_1
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3]
DUD DUD DUDU
Dm                                                    Bbmaj7  
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
                              Csus4
I know you're the reason I believe in life 
                                       Fmaj7sus2
What's the day without a little night?
                                   Dm
I'm just tryna shed a little light
               Bbmaj7   
It can be hard
                  Fadd9
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
    Csus4
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Single strums
Dm
I been on the low
                 Bbmaj7
I been taking my time
                          Fadd9
I feel like I'm out of my mind
                           Csus4
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
                Dm   
I finally wanna be alive 
Bbmaj7               Csus4
I finally wanna be alive
                        Fmaj7sus2
I don't wanna die today 
                  Dm
I don't wanna die
                       Bbmaj7  
Finally wanna be alive
                     Csus4 
I finally wanna be alive
                  Fmaj7sus2
I don't wanna die

[Outro]
Pick Bb C Dm F
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
                  Dm   
But I don't wanna cry
              Bbmaj7
I don't wanna cry anymore
               Fadd9
I wanna feel alive
                   Csus4
I don't even wanna die anymore
                 Dm  
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
              Bbmaj7
I don't wanna             
                          Fadd9 Csus4
I don't even wanna die anymore

Pick Bb C Dm F
