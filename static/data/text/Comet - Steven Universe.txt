C                  Am        
Some say I have no direction,

                       G           
That I'm a light-speed distraction,

                       F        
But that's a knee-jerk reaction.

C                       Am      
Still this is the final frontier

              G       
Everything is so clear

              F        G
to my destiny I steer. 

Am               G                      F      G
This life in the stars is all I've ever known. 

          Am                    G                F    
Stars and stardust and infinite space is my only home.

        C                     G    
But the moment that I hit the stage

             F                          
Thousands of voices are calling my name.

      Am                         G                   F     
And I know in my heart it's been worth it all of the while.

          C                  G       
And as my albums fly off the shelves,

            F                          
Handing out autographed pics of myself,

            Am                   G                     F    
This life I chose isn't easy but sure is one heck of a ride.

       D                     A    
At the moment that I hit the stage

           G                        
I hear the universe calling my name.

      Bm                         A                 G    
And I know deep down in my heart I have nothing to fear.

           D                           A   
And as the solar wind blows through my hair

          G                               
knowing I have so much more left to share,

  Bm                                 A                         G     
a wandering spirit whose tearing its way through the cold atmosphere.

             D     
I fly like a comet.

            D     
Soar like a comet.

             D     
Crash like a comet.

           D     
I'm just a comet.
