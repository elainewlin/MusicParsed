[Chorus]

Am               C                   G
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
Am                      C                    G
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been livin in, A-and
Am                 C          G
if you do not want to see me again
G            Am      C      G
I will Under-sta---i-a---i-and
G            Am      C      G
I will under-sta---i-a---i-and


[Verse]

Am 
The angry boy, a bit too insane,
C 
icing over a secret pain,
G
You know you don't belong,
Am
You're the first to fight, you're way too loud,
C
You're the flash of light, on a burial shroud
G
I know something's wrong
Am                       C             G
Well everyone I know has got a reason, to say, put the past away


[Chorus]

Am               C                   G
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
Am                      C             G
You could cut ties with all the lies, that you've been livin in, a-and
Am                    C       G
if you do not want to see me again,
G             Am      C      G
I would under-sta---i-a---i-and
G             Am          C      G
I would Under-sta-a-a---i-a---i-and


[Verse]

Am
Well he's on the table and he's gone to code,
C 
And I do not think anyone knows what they are,
G 
doing here-er
Am 
And your friends have left, you've been dismissed,
C 
I never thougt it would come to this, and
G
I, I want you to know-o
Am                C             G
Everyone's got to face down the demons, maybe today, we can put the past away


[Chorus]

Am               C                   G
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
Am                      C                     G
you could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in, A-and
Am                 C          G
if you do not want to see me again,
G             Am       C      G
I would under-sta---i-a---i-and
G             Am      C      G
I would under-sta---i-a---i-and
G             Am      C      G
I would under-sta---i-a---i-a-and
