Verse 1:

G              C
Hey, where did we go
G              D
Days when the rains came ?
G           C
Down in the hollow
G         D
Playing a new game,
G            C
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
G            D
Skipping and a-jumping
G            C
In the misty morning fog with our,
G          D
Our hearts a-thumping
    C    D             G      Em
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
C       D          G      D7
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Verse 2:
G        C
Whatever happened
G              D
To Tuesday and so slow
G                     C
Going down to the old mine with a
G          D
Transistor radio.
G               C
Standing in the sunlight laughing
G             D
Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
G            C
Slipping and a-sliding
G             D
All along the waterfall
     C       D           G     Em
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
C       D          G
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Verse 2:

G          C
So hard to find my way
G                D
Now that I'm all on my own.
G                  C
I saw you just the other day,
G       D
My, how you have grown!
G              C
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
G                     D
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
G                  C
Making love in the green grass
G          D
Behind the stadium
     C       D          G      Em
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
C       D          G
You, my brown-eyed girl.


Chorus:

Do you remember when we used to sing
G         C           G               D
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
G         C           G               D
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
G
