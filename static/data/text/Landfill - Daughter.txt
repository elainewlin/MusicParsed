Verse:
Bm            D
Throw me in a landfill
G                    A
Don't think about the consequences
Bm              D
Throw me in the dirt pit
G                     A
Don't think about the choices that you make
Bm              D
Throw me in the water
G                     A
Don't think about the splash I will create
Bm                 D
Leave me at the alter
G                A
Knowing all the things you just escaped

Verse:
Bm             D
Push me out to sea
G             A
On a little boat that you made out
Bm         D     G                    A
Of the evergreen that you helped your father cut away
Bm              D
Leave me on the tracks
G                 A
To wait until the morning train arrives
Bm                  D
Don't you dare look back
G          A
Walk away, catch up with the sunrise

Chorus:
     Bm   G  Gbm   A         Bm  D
Cos' this is torturous electricity
        G       A      Bm   G
Between both of us and this is
D     A               Bm     D
Dangerous cos' I want you so much
      G         A
But I hate your guts

I hate you

Verse:
Bm                 D
So leave me in the cold
G              A
Wait until the snow covers me up
Bm          D
So I cannot move
G         A
So I'm embedded in the frost
Bm              D
Leave me in the rain
G             A                   Bm
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
               D
Wipe away your tear stains
G                    A
Thought you said you didn't feel pain

Chorus:
     Bm   G  Gbm   A         Bm  D
Well this is torturous electricity
        G       A      Bm   G
Between both of us and this is
D     A               Bm     D
Dangerous cos' I want you so much
      G         A            Bm     D
But I hate your guts. I want you so much
      G         A
But I hate your guts.
     Bm   G  Gbm   A         Bm  D
Well this is torturous electricity
        G       A      Bm   G
Between both of us and this is
D     A               Bm     D
Dangerous cos' I want you so much
      G         A
But I hate your guts


       Bm     D          G         A
I want you so much but I hate your guts
