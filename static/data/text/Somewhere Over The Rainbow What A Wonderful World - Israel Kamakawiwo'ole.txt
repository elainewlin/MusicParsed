G         D
Somewhere over the rainbow

C      G
Way up high

C        G
And the dreams...

D               Em   C
Once in a lullaby

G         D
Somewhere over...

C          G
Blue birds fly

C        G
And the dreams...

D                     Em     C
Dreams really do come true

G
Someday...

D                                   Em     C
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me

G
Where trouble...

D                               Em            C
High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me

G         D                C        G
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly

C       G                         D                  Em     G
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

G                    D         C        G
Well I see trees of green and Red roses too,

C               G         D       Em
I'll watch then bloom for me and you

C
And I think...

D                 Em    C
What a wonderful world

G                   D              C          G
Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white

C                     G
And the brightness of day

D           Em
I like the dark

C
And I think...

D                Em    C
What a wonderful world

D                            Em
The colors of the rainbow so pr...

D                        Em

C                     G
I see friends shaking h...

         C           G
Saying, "How do you do?"

C              G        C         D
They're really saying, I...I love you

G             D          C         G
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,

C                  G
They'll learn much more

D           Em
Than we'll know

C
And I think to myself

D                 Em    C
What a wonderful world

G
Someday I'll wish...

D                   Em     C
Wake up where ... behind me

G
Where trouble...

D               Em           C
High above ... where you'll find me

G          D
Somewhere over...

C      G
Way up high

C        G                         D                  Em   C    G
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?
