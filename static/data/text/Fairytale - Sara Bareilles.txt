G                   Dm7
Cinderella's on her bedroom floor
Dm7
She's got a
F                       Am
Crush on the guy at the liquor store
G                             Dm7
Cause Mr. Charming don't come home anymore
F                       C    F
And she forgets why she came here
G                      Dm7
Sleeping Beauty's in a foul mood
Dm7
For shame she says
F                         Am
None for you dear prince, I'm tired today
G                   Dm7             F             C            F
I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming

[Chorus:]
Am G    F    C        Am G  F
I don't care for your fairytales
G                                         C
You're so worried about the maiden though you know
Dm7                        Am  G    F
She's only waiting on the next best thing
F
next best thing

G
Snow White is doing dishes again cause
Dm7
What else could you do
     F                Am
With seven itty-bitty men?
G                         Dm7
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
F                        C   F
Says will you meet me at midnight?
G                          Dm7
The tall blonde lets out a cry of despair says
F                                  Am
Would have cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair
G                         Dm7                 F                  C  F
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows

[Chorus]
G                             Dm7
Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom
F                                Am
Man made up a story said that I should believe him
G                                       Dm7
Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight
F                    C         F
But I don't want the next best thing
F          G            Dm7        F           Am
So I sing - I hold my head down and I break these walls round me

F                          Dm7
Can't take no more of your fairytale love

Am G     F
I don't care
C        Am G  F
For your fairytales
G                                 C
You're so worried bout the maiden though you know
Dm7                
She's only waiting 
Am
spent the whole life being
G             F           Am             G    F
graded on the sanctity of patience and a dumb appreciation
        Am               G             F            Am
But the story needs some mending and a better happy ending
        G              F         Am
Cause I don't want the next best thing
        G              F         Am
No no I don't want the next best thing
