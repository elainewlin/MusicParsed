[Verse 1]

D   
Here is my new song
    A   
And it didn't take long
Bm
It's not a cover
  G   
I hope you won't bother
     D   
It's not karaoke
    A   
I'm keeping it low key
      Bm
Well, I'm not a psychic,
      G   
But I hope that you like it

[Pre-Chorus]

D   
Here it goes now,
A   
Don't make me nervous
       Bm             G   
'Cause all I got is a few random verses
  D                A   
I hope it gets you under the surface
  Bm                       G   
I tried my best 'cause you really deserve it

[Chorus]

D          A                           Bm
oooh, ooh, ooh, I want to live for the moments
         G                           D   
That are gone before we're thinking about them
            A                               Bm
I'm singing this 'cause we'd be nothing without them
               G    
And this is my anthem yeah
D          A                           Bm
oooh, ooh, ooh, I want to live for the feelings
          G                  D   
That keep giving this life a meaning
            A                                Bm
I'm singing this because we'd be nothing without them
               G   
And this is my anthem, yeah


[Verse 2]

D   
Maybe it's tacky
     A   
This song makes me happy
     Bm
Will you sing it with me?
G   
Possibly maybe
   D   
If you think it's cheesy
   A   
If you're singing off-key
   Bm
It won't matter to me
       G   
'Cause I'm feeling sunny

[Pre-Chorus]

D   
Here it goes now,
A   
Don't you get nervous
       Bm                 G   
'Cause all we've got is a few random verses
  D                  A   
I know it'll get you under the surface
   Bm                    G   
It can't go wrong 'cause nobody's perfect!

[Chorus]

D          A                           Bm
oooh, ooh, ooh, I want to live for the moments
         G                           D   
That are gone before we're thinking about them
            A                               Bm
I'm singing this 'cause we'd be nothing without them
               G    
And this is my anthem yeah

That keep giving this life a meaning
            A                                Bm
I'm singing this because we'd be nothing without them
               G   
And this is my anthem, yeah


[Bridge]
