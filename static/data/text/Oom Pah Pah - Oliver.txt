[Verse 1]
Db 
There's a little ditty 
        Eb7
They're singing in the city,
  Ab7 
Especially when they've been 
       Gb         Ab
On the gin or the beer,
Db 
If you've got the patience, 
     Eb7
Your own imagination
     Ab7                        Db
Will tell you just exactly what you want to hear.
  
[Chorus]
Db
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Eb7
That's how it goes,
Ab7 
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Db       Ab7
Everyone knows,
Db                         Gb      Eb7
They all suppose what they want to suppose,
Ab             Ab7     Db  Ab7
When they hear oom-pah-pah.

[Verse 2]
Db                           
Mister Percy Snodgrass would 
Eb7
Often have the odd glass
    Ab7 
But never when he thought 
   Gb         Ab
Anybody could see,
Db 
Secretly he'd buy it, 
    Eb7
And drink it on the quiet,  
    Ab7 
And dream he was an Earl 
       Db
With a girl on each knee.

[Chorus]
Db
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Eb7
That's how it goes,
Ab7 
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Db       Ab7
Everyone knows,
Db                       Gb        Eb7
What is the cause of his red shiny nose,
Ab          Ab7     Db  Ab7
Could it be oom-pah-pah.

[Verse 3]
Db 
Pretty little Sally 
     Eb7
Goes walking down the alley,
   Ab7                         Gb        Ab
Displays her pretty ankles for all of the men,
Db 
They could see her garters, 
    Eb7
But not for free and gratis
   Ab7 
An inch or two, and then 
          Db
She knows when to say when.


[Chorus]
Db
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Eb7
That's how it goes,
Ab7 
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Db       Ab7
Everyone knows,
Db                      Gb         Eb7
Whether it's hidden, or whether it shows,
Ab            Ab7     Db  Ab7
It's the same oom-pah-pah.

[Verse 4]
Db 
She was from the country, 
    Eb7
But now she's up a gum-tree
    Ab7 
She let a feller feed her, 
     Gb         Ab
Then lead her along,
Db 
What's the good of crying, 
      Eb7
She's made a bed to lie in,
      Ab7 
She's glad to bring a coin in, 
    Db
And join in this song.

[Chorus]
Db
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Eb7
That's how it goes,
Ab7 
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Db       Ab7
Everyone knows,
Db                   Gb            Eb7
She is no longer the same blushin' rose
Ab         Ab7       Db Ab7
Ever since OOOOM-PAH-PAH.


[Chorus]
Db
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Eb7
That's how it goes,
Ab7 
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah, 
Db       Ab7
Everyone knows,
Db                         Gb      Eb7
They all suppose what they want to suppose,
Ab             Ab7     Db   Ab7  Db
When they hear oom-pah-pah. Pah. Pah.
