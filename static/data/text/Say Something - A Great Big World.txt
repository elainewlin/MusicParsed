[Chorus]

Am               F               C        G
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Am              F                  C        G
  I'll be the one, if you want me to.
Am           F                    C         G
  Anywhere, I would've followed you.
Am                F                C        G
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.


[Verse]

    C                Em
And I am feeling so small.
        F
It was over my head
                  C     G
I know nothing at all.

    C                   Em
And I will stumble and fall.
            F
I'm still learning to love
                 C     G
Just starting to crawl.


[Chorus]

Am               F               C        G
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Am              F                  C        G
  I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.
Am           F                    C         G
  Anywhere, I would've followed you.
Am                F                C        G
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.


[Verse]

    C                  Em
And I will swallow my pride.
            F
You're the one that I love
                   C        G
And I'm saying goodbye.


[Chorus]

Am               F               C        G
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Am                F                  C        G
 And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.
Am           F                    C         G
  Anywhere, I would've followed you.
Am                F                C        G
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.
