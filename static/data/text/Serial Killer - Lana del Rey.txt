[Verse 1]

G#m
 Wish I may, wish I might,
  Emaj7
Find my one true love tonight.
B
If you think that he,
         F#
Could be you?

G#m
If I pray really tight,
 Emaj7
Get into a fake bar fight,
B
While I'm walking down,
        F#
The avenue.

 G#m
If I lay really quiet,
Emaj7
I know that what I do isn't right,
B                             F#
I can't stop what I love to do.

      G#m
So I murder love in the night,
  Emaj7                                B
Watching them fall one by one they fight,
                               F#
Do you think you'll love me too?
