[Chorus]
Em                   C             G
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah
    Em                          C             G
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah
          Em                      C                    G
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let move right through ya
        Em               C                 G
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your prayers

[Verse]

Em                 C                G
My life started the day I got caught under the covers with second hand lovers
Em           C                       G
Oh tied up in pretty young thing in a state of emergency who was I trying to be


[Pre-Chorus]
        Em            C          G
Then the time for being sad is over and you miss 'em like you miss no other
Em            C                     G
And being blue is better then being over it, over it


[Chorus]
Em                   C             G
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah
    Em                          C             G
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah
          Em                      C                    G
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let move right through ya
        Em               C                 G
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your prayers


[Verse]
Em                C                         G
I was drunk and it didn't mean a thing, stop thinking about the bullets from my mouth
Em                 C                        G
I love the things you hate about yourself just finished a day dream who were you trying to be?
    

[Pre-Chorus]
Em            C          G
Then the time for being sad is over and you miss 'em like you miss no other
Em            C                     G                 F#m  Bm
And being blue is better then being over it, over it

Em           C
Ohhhhhh-oh-oh-oh

   Em                         C
No one wants you when you have no heart and
           G                        G
I’m sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
         Em                      C
You’ll never know if you don’t ever try again
      G
So let’s try
G
Let’s try
G
Let’s try


[Chorus]
Em                   C             G
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah
  Em                          C             G
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah
        Em                      C                    G
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let move right through ya
      Em               C                 G
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your prayers
