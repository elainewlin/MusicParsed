[Verse]

          C                     Em
He said let's get out of this town
                   D
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
            C                    Em
I thought heaven can't help me now
                  D                                C
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
                   Em
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
D
He's so bad but does it so well
 C                 Em              D
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is


[Chorus]

  G                   D
Say you'll remember me
                Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
  G                  D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                   Am                  C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
  G         D      Am      C
Wildest dreams
  G         D      Am      C
Wildest dreams


[Verse]

        C                         Em
I say no one has to know what we do
                      D
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
           C                  Em                     D
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
                           C
But this is getting good now
                    Em
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
D
He's so bad but does it so well
C                   Em
When we've had our very last kiss
     D
My last request is


[Chorus]

  G                   D
Say you'll remember me
                Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
  G                  D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                   Am                  C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your 
  G         D      Am      C
Wildest dreams
  G         D      Am      C
Wildest dreams


[Bridge]

         G
You'll see me in hindsight
  D
Tangled up with you all night
  Am          C
Burning it down
  G
Someday when you leave me
 D                     Am           C
I bet these memories follow you around
      G
You see me in hindsight
  D
Tangled up with you all night
  Am         C
Burning it down
  G
Some day when you leave me
 D                     Am           C
I bet these memories follow you around


[Chorus]

  G                   D
Say you'll remember me
                Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
  G                  D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                   Am                  C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
  G                   D
Say you'll remember me
                Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
  G                  D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                   Am                  C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your 
  G         D      Am      C
Wildest dreams
  G         D      Am      C
Wildest dreams
                            G         D      Am      C
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
          G         D      Am      C
In your wildest dreams
