CAPO 1
[Verse]

        C                     Em
He said let's get out of this town
                 D
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
          C                    Em
I thought heaven can't help me now
                  D                              C
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
                  Em
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
D
 He's so bad but does it so well
C                  Em              D
 I can see the end as it begins my one condition is


[Chorus]

G                   D
Say you'll remember me
              Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
G                 D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                  Am                 C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
G       D           Am    C
Wildest dreams oh uh   oh 
G       D           Am    C
Wildest dreams oh uh   oh 


[Verse]
      C                          Em
I say no one has to know what we do
                    D
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
        C                   Em                      D
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
                         C
But this is getting good now
                  Em
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
D
 He's so bad but does it so well
C                  Em
When we've had our very last kiss
   D
My last request is


[Chorus]

G                   D
Say you'll remember me
              Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
G                 D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                  Am                 C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your 
G       D           Am    C
Wildest dreams oh uh   oh 
G       D           Am    C
Wildest dreams oh uh   oh 

[Bridge]

       G
You'll see me in hindsight 
D
Tangled up with you all night
Am         C
Burning it down
G
Someday when you leave me
D                    Am          C
I bet these memories follow you around
    G
You see me in hindsight
D
Tangled up with you all night
Am         C
Burning it down
G
Someday when you leave me
D                    Am          C
I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around)


[Chorus]
Octave lower
G                   D
Say you'll remember me
              Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
G                 D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                  Am                 C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]

G                   D
Say you'll remember me
              Am                         C
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
G                 D
Red lips and rosy cheeks
                  Am                 C
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
G       D           Am    C
Wildest dreams oh uh   oh (ah-ahhh)
        G       D            Am   
In your wildest dreams oh uh   oh 
              C             G       D            Am     C
(Even if it's just) in your wildest dreams oh uh    oh
        G       D            Am   C
In your wildest dreams oh uh   oh
