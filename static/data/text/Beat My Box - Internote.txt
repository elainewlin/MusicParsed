Hey there old friend, we’ve been through quite a bit
G                                                              F                     G7
Just throwing this out there, so don’t overthink it
C                                           Am
But I’ve been thinking I like what you do with your mouth
G                                                         F             C
Maybe we could shut the door and see if things go south

    Am          G             G7
And hey, I just want to say
              F           Am                 C7
You can beat my box any day

    F            Dm                        G
And I know we go back for days, and if you hadn’t looked at me that way
F         Am     G
In years ago
     Am            Dm                           G              E7
Then maybe I could let it lie, but I see you looking hella fly
      Am      F     G7
And I want to know

C               Am
So I stay over late one drunken night
G                  F            G7
Things got hot and heavy by the glow of the Netflix light
C                              Am
Tiptoe up the staircase, don’t worry ‘bout Lauren and Pat
G                        G7                    F          C
I said if you take your boots off then I will show you my cat

     F                  Dm                    G
And I’m not looking for complication, but you make me feel like first in the nation
     F      Am     G
When you go down
       Am                     Dm                  G                 E7
‘Cause you’ve got the rhythm, I’ve got the blues, come together and everything moves
        Am       F        G7
When we make our sound

(SPOKEN) Sorry, Lauren and Pat

      C                                Am
Well, hey there buddy, we’ve been through quite a lot
G                                                      F                            G7
Lord knows we’re talented, and yeah, we’re both hot
     C                              Am
And you may think we’re playing a risky game
    G                                               F              C
But I don’t know, I love the sound when I'm singing your name

   Am   G                    G7
So hey, I just want to say
              F       Am   C
You can beat my box any day
