[Verse]
       D               F#m          G         A
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
         D          F#m       G       A
And then suddenly I bump into you
D                   F#m                G         A
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
          D              F#m              Bm          A
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
         Bm
But with you (But with you)
        D
I found my place (I see your face)
         E                              G7
And it's nothing like I've ever known before
[Chorus]
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                D
Love is an open door
      F#m            E
With you (with you). With you (with you)!
G7              D   F#m  G  A
Love is an open door
[Instrumental]
D   F#m   G   A
[Verse]
            E
I mean it's crazy
   G#m                  A        B
We finish each other's... Sandwiches! (that's what I was gonna say!)
           E
I've never met someone
    G#m                 A    B
Who thinks so much like me
    E               G#m
Our mental synchronization
    A                 B
Can have but one explanation
E         G#m
You (and I) were (just)
         A      B
Meant to be
        C#m
Say goodbye (say goodbye)
        E
To the pain of the past
F#                         A7
We don't have to feel it anymore
[Chorus]
                E   G#m  F#  A7
Love is an open door
                E   G#m  F#  A7
Love is an open door
                    E
Life can be so much more
       G#m           F#
With you (with you). With you (with you)!
A7              E
Love is an open door (door)
