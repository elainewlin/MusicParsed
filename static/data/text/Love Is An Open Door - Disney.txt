[Anna] All my life has been a series of doors in my face
         D               Dadd4/F#    D/G       A7sus4
And then suddenly I bump into you

D                   Dadd4/F#              D/G     A7sus4

          D              Dadd4/F#            Em7         A7sus4
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
[Anna] *giggles*

    E               Eadd4/G#
Our mental synchronization

Can have but one explanation
       E         
[Hans] You 
[Anna] and I
       
[Hans] were 
       Eadd4/G#
[Anna] just

[Hans] Say goodbye

              E
[Both] To the pain of the past
