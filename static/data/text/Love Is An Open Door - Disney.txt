[Verse]

       C               Em          F         G
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
         C          Em       F       G
And then suddenly I bump into you
C                   Em                F         G
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
          C              Em              Am          G
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
         Am
But with you
        C
I found my place
         D                              F7
And it's nothing like I've ever known before


[Chorus]

                C   Em  D  F7
Love is an open door
                C   Em  D  F7
Love is an open door
                C
Love is an open door
      Em            D
With you, with you. With you, with you!
F7              C   Em  F  G
Love is an open door


[Instrumental]
C   Em   F   G


[Verse]

            D
I mean it's crazy
   F#m                  G        A
We finish each other's...  Sandwiches! (that's what I was gonna say!)
           D
I've never met someone
    F#m                 G    A
Who thinks so much like me
    D               F#m
Our mental synchronization
    G                 A
Can have but one explanation
D         F#m
You and I were just     
         G      A
Meant to be
        Bm
Say goodbye
        D
To the pain of the past
E                         G7
We don't have to feel it anymore


[Chorus]

                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                    D
Life can be so much more
       F#m           E
With you, with you. With you, with you!
G7              D
Love is an open door
