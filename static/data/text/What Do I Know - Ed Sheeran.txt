Verse 1:
C                 G       Am
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
G   F                  Em        F      G
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
   C                   G           Am             G
My daddy told me, "son, don't you get involved in
F                  Em        F       G
Politics, religions or other people's quarrels"

Pre-Chorus:
F                       Am     G       C
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
F                                     Am           G
I know when I have children they will know what it means
      C                                Am       G
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
     F                       G
Just love and understanding, positivity

Chorus:
         C                       G      Am
We could change this whole world with a piano
   G  F          Em             F        G
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
C                   G       Am
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
G  F           Em          F            G
No university, no degree, but lord knows
C             G          Am
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
   G   F             Em         F          G
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
       C               G          Am
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
   G     F               Em            F
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
       G           C G   Am
But what do I know?
G   F                Em          F
Love can change the world in a moment
    G             C G   Am
But what do I know?
G   F                   Em     F      G
Love can change the world in a moment

Verse 2:
    C                 G          Am
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
G  F                Em        F        G
I saw people marching in the streets today
   C                      G         Am
You know we are made up of love and hate
G   F                Em        F        G
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

Pre-Chorus:
F                          Am  G            C
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
      F                          Am   G            C
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
       F                          Am    G          C
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
     F                       G
It's love and understanding, positivity

Chorus:
         C                       G      Am
We could change this whole world with a piano
   G  F          Em             F        G
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
C                   G       Am
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
G  F           Em          F            G
No university, no degree, but lord knows
C             G          Am
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
   G   F             Em         F          G

But what do I know?
G   F                Em          F
Love can change the world in a moment
    G             C G   Am
But what do I know?
G   F                   Em     F      G
Love can change the world in a moment

Pre-Chorus:
F                          Am   G           C
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
      F                          Am     G        C
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
      F                           Am  G        C
So let's all get together, we can all be free
       F                       G
Spread love and understanding, positivity

Chorus:
         C                       G      Am
We could change this whole world with a piano
