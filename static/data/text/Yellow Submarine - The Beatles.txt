      D             G 
In the town where I was born
        Am               D 
Lived a man who sailed to sea
        D          G 
And he told us of his life
      Am           D 
In the land of submarines

        D          G 
So we sailed up to the sun
        Am          D 
Till we found the sea of green
         D              G 
And we lived beneath the waves
        Am         D 
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus]

G             D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G             D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

        D               G 
And our friends are all on board
      Am                  D 
Many more of them live next door
         D          G    
And the band begins to play

[Chorus]

G             D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G             D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

        D          G
As we live a life of ease
      Am              D
Everyone of us has all we need
        D            G
Sky of blue and sea of green
       Am          D
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus]

G             D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G             D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
