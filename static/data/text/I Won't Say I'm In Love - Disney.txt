[Verse 1 - Meg]
C/G                            F/G
If there's a prize for rotten judgment
C/G                  F/G G
I guess I've already won that
Am                  D7
No man is worth the aggravation
G                       F/G  G      F/G  G
That's ancient history, been there, done that

[Pre-Chorus - Background]
C

F                  G
He's the earth and heaven to ya
C                      Am           
Try to keep it hidden, honey we can see right through ya
F
Girl ya can't conceal it
C/E                                   Dm         G
We know how you're feelin' who you're thinking of

[Chorus]
      C                                     Am
[Meg] No chance, no way, I won't say it, no no
                                                 F
[Background] You swoon, you sigh why deny it, uh oh
                    G
[Meg] It's too...clich√©
                   C
I won't say I'm in love

[Verse 2 - Meg]
C                                  F
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
C/E                      G                      
It feels so good when ya start out
Am                          D
My head is screaming "get a grip, girl!"
G                       F/G G    F/G   G
"Unless you're dying to cry your heart out!"

[Pre-Chorus - Background]
C
You keep on denying
F               G 
Who you are and how you're feelin'
C                      Am 
Baby, we're not lying, hon we saw ya hit the ceiling 
F
Face it like a grown up
C/E                          Dm                   G
When ya gonna own up that ya got, got, got it bad

[Chorus]
      C                                     Am
[Meg] No chance, no way, I won't say it, no no
[Background] Give up, give in
                          F
Check the grin, you're in love!
[Meg] The scene won't play
                   G
I won't say I'm in love
                                            C      
(You're doing flips read our lips you're in love)
                                                     Am   
You're way off base I won't say it (she won't say it)
Get off my case, I won't say it
F              G                         C
(Girl don't be proud, it's ok, you're in love)
Am             F                G
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh, at least out loud
