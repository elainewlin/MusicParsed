[Verse 1]
       F                    C7
It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
                              F
It's a world of hopes, it's a world of fear
                        F7               
There's so much that we share
          Bb          Bbm
That it's time we're aware
       C7                F
It's a small world after all

[Chorus]
F                     C7
It's a small world    after all
                    F           
It's a small world  after all
       F7            Bb        Bbm
It's a small world   after    all
       C7           F
It's a small, small world

[Verse 2]
       F                    C7
There is just one moon and one golden sun
                             F
And a smile means friendship to everyone
                        F7       
Though the mountains divide 
        Bb          Bbm
and the oceans are wide
       C7                F
It's a small world after all.

[Chorus]
F                     C7
It's a small world    after all
                    F           
It's a small world  after all
       F7            Bb        Bbm
It's a small world   after    all
       C7           F
It's a small, small world
