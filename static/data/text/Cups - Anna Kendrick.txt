C
I got my ticket for the long way ‘round
Am                            C
Two bottle ‘a whiskey for the way
F                          Am
And I sure would like some sweet company
G                                   C
And I’m leaving tomorrow, wha-do-ya say?
 
Am
When I’m gone
 
When I’m gone
F                             C
You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone
Am
You’re gonna miss me by my hair
F
You’re gonna miss me everywhere, oh
G                             C
You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone
 
C
I’ve got my ticket for the long way ‘round
Am                            C
The one with the prettiest of views
         F                   Am               C
It’s got mountains, it’s got rivers, it’s got sights to give you shivers
G                                  C
But it sure would be prettier with you
 
Am
When I’m gone
 
When I’m gone
F                             C
You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone
Am
You’re gonna miss me by my walk
F
You’re gonna miss me by my talk, oh
G                             C
You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone
