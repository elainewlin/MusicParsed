MAKE SURE YOU TUNE DOWN TO D ON ALL YOUR STRINGS.

[Verse 1]
Em               C                   G
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
                   Gadd9     
You don't know how lovely you are
Em             C
I had to find you
                G
Tell you I need you
      Gadd9
Tell you I set you apart
Em                C
Tell me your secrets
                     G
And ask me your questions
             Gadd9
Oh, let's go back to the start
Em               C 
Running in circles
             G
Coming up tails
              G/F#
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
C                    G
Nobody said it was easy
               Gadd9
It's such a shame for us to part
C                   G
Nobody said it was easy
                  Gadd9              D
No one ever said it would be this hard
                            G
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
Em                C
I was just guessing
                   G
At numbers and figures
            Gadd9
Pulling the puzzles apart
Em               C
Questions of science
                  G
Science and progress
              Gadd9
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Em               C
Tell me you love me
                 G
Come back and haunt me
          Gadd9
Oh, and I rush to the start
Em              C
Running in circles
               G
Chasing our tails
       G/F#
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
C                     G
Nobody said it was easy
                 Gadd9
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
C                    G
Nobody said it was easy
               Gadd9               D
No one ever said it would be so hard
                           G
I'm going back to the start
