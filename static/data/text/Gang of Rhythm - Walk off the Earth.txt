[Verse 1]
F                                                      Gm
 I got this old guitar, the strings are rusty but it's all I need
                             A#
Bring in the kick drum it can back the beat
                               Dm  C
Let's gather round and sing a song    (hey!)
F                                                    Gm
 I got a shaker too, the kind of sound that wants to make you move
                             A#
Bring in the uke it will complete the groove
                               Dm  C
Let's gather round and sing a song    (hey!)


[Pre-Chorus]
Dm           C              A#       C
 There's no worries on the earth tonight
Dm          C               A#       C
 We're all walkin' off the world tonight


[Chorus]
F            A#             F            C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone
F              A#        F           C
 We're like a locomotive under the big hot sun
F                      A#             F             C
 We're chained to the gang of rhythm, the song is never done
F            A#             F            C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone

[Verse 2]
F                                                Gm
 We got this melody, bring in the harmonies like CSNY
                             A#                                          Dm  C
To write a tune you know will never die, let's gather round and sing a song


[Pre Chorus]
Dm           C              A#       C
 There's no worries on the earth tonight
Dm          C               A#       C
 We're all walkin' off the world tonight




[Chorus]
F            A#             F            C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone
F              A#        F           C
 We're like a locomotive under the big hot sun
F                      A#             F             C
 We're chained to the gang of rhythm, the song is never done
F            A#             F            C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone

[Bridge]   
F                       Dm                           C
 And when the night is done these chains will hold us strong
                      Gm                           C
The chords will carry on long after we're gone     oh oh


[Pre-Chorus]
Dm           C              A#       C
 There's no worries on the earth tonight
Dm          C               A#       C
 We're all walkin' off the world tonight


[Chorus]
F            C/E           Dm           C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone
F             C/E       Dm           C
 We're like a locomotive under the big hot sun

F            A#             F            C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone
F              A#        F           C
 We're like a locomotive under the big hot sun
F                      A#             F             C
 We're chained to the gang of rhythm, the song is never done
F            A#             F            C
 Come on now everybody yeah come on now everyone

F             A#     Gm       C
 We got this melody, come on everyone
F              A#      Gm       C
 Bring in the harmony, come on everyone

F
 I got this old guitar, the strings are rusty
