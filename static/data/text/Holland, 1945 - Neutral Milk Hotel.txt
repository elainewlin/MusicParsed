C                    G
The only girl I've ever loved
C                      G
Was born with roses in her eyes
C                        G
But then they buried her alive
            D              C
One evening nineteen-forty-five
              D             G
With just her sister at her side
         D                C
And only weeks before the guns
             D             G
All came and rained on everyone
            D             C
Now she's a little boy in Spain
        D                  G
Playing pianos filled with flames
         D                C
On empty rings around the sun
            D                G
All sing to say my dream has come


                C             G
But now we must pick up every piece    
       C               G
Of the life we used to love
        C  
Just to keep ourselves
    G                D   
At least enough to carry on

 C                         G
And now we ride the circus wheel
C                                G
With your dark brother wrapped in white
C                       G   
Says it was good to be alive
           D               C
But now he rides a comet's flame
             D            G
And won't be coming back again
                D             C
The Earth looks better from a star
              D                   G
That's right above from where you are
          D                C
He didn't mean to make you cry
                 D                G
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
         D                 C
On empty rings around your heart
               D                  G
The world just screams and falls apart

               
                 C             G
But now we must pick up every piece    
       C               G
Of the life we used to love
        C  
Just to keep ourselves
    G                D   
At least enough to carry on


    G      A     C    C      G
And here's where your mother sleeps
    G    A  C   C               G             D
And here is the room where your brothers were born
G A  C     C      G
Indentions in the sheets
            G A    C    C               G      D
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
            C      G       C     G
And it's so sad to see the world agree
            C                G                 D
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
G   A    C   C       G          D               G
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes
