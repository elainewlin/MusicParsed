CAPO 1 
[Verse 1]
F                      C
 Step out into the Indian dust
Dm                    
 I can feel the cracks in my spirit
Bb                     C
 They're starting to bust
F
 Drive by your house
           C     
 Nobody's home
Dm                                 Bb             C
 I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

[Chorus]
F                   C
 All my friends say I should move on
Dm                       Bb
 She's just another girl
               C                         F
 Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
                           C
 And all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
Dm                          Bb
 And it's a great big world
       C            F
 She's just another girl 
 C          Dm    Bb  C
   (another girl)


[Verse 2]
  F
I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
C                             
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
  Dm                                                            
I can't believe you're out there 
                          Bb  C
Flying with someone else uh-huh
    F
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
  C                     
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Dm                                                  Bb
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
             C
And give him all of my love


[Chorus]
F                   C
 All my friends say I should move on
Dm                       Bb
 She's just another girl
               C                         F
 Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
                           C
 And all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
Dm                          Bb
 And it's a great big world
       C            Dm
 She's just another girl 


[Bridge]
Dm          C                              Bbadd9 
 I could be reeling them in left and right
                          C            Dm
 Something's got a hold on me, tonight
            C                                 Bbadd9
 Well maybe all of my friends should confront
                 C
 The fact that I don't want another girl

F C Dm

Dm                     Bb               C
 All of my friends say I should move on
F
 All of my friends say
C          
 All of my friends say
Dm                     Bb 
 All of my friends say
       C            F
 She's just another girl

F
 Then why can't I sleep at night
C                 
 And why don't the moon look right
Dm                            Bb
 The sound's off but the TV's on
                            C
 And it's a great big world


[Outro]
                   Bb
She's just another girl,
                                         C
Don't let her stick it to your heart boys
                   Bb
She's just another girl
                  C                   F     C
All my friends say she's just another girl
        Dm   Bb C F
Another girl
