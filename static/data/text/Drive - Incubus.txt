[Verse 1]
Em7                                       Cmaj7          Am7
Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
Em7                                           Cmaj7
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
                   Am7
Take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus]
Cmaj7          A7                         Cmaj7
It's driven me before and seems to have a vague
A7              Cmaj7
Haunting mass appeal 
           A7               Cmaj7
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
              A7
Should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Em7
Whatever tomorrow brings
     Cmaj7              Am7
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea
Em7
Whatever tomorrow brings
     Cmaj7         Am7
I'll be there I'll be there

[Verse 2]
Em7
So, if I decide to waiver my chance
   Cmaj7             Am7
To be one of the hive
Em7
Will I choose water over wine
            Cmaj7
And hold my own and drive?
Am7
Aah ah ooo

[Pre-Chorus]
Cmaj7          A7                            Cmaj7
It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
          A7                   Cmaj7
That everyone else gets around
           A7                         Cmaj7
But lately I'm beginning to find that when
           A7
I drive myself my light is found

[Chorus]
Em7
Whatever tomorrow brings
     Cmaj7              Am7
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea
Em7
Whatever tomorrow brings
     Cmaj7         Am7
I'll be there I'll be there

Cmaj7      A7               Cmaj7
Would you choose water over wine?
A7
Hold the wheel and drive

[Chorus]
Em7
Whatever tomorrow brings
     Cmaj7              Am7
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea
Em7
Whatever tomorrow brings
     Cmaj7         Am7
I'll be there I'll be there
