CAPO 1 

[Verse 1]

Em      D/F#  G
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
C              G/B C         G/B C                D
I know I should've fought it, at least I'am being honest

Em          D/F#     G
Feel like a failure, cause I know that I failed you
C                G/B C       G/B   C                D
I should've done you better, cause you don't want a liar


[Pre-Chorus]

      Em                D/F#                 G
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything but boy, I couldn't
C            G/B C     G/B C        D
give it   to       you

      Em                D/F#                 G
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything but I got nothing
C            G/B C     G/B C        D
here    without    you


[Chorus]

   Em     D/F#   G
So one    last   time I need to
C  G/B C   G/B C         D
be the one who takes you home

Em    D/F#    G
One   more    time I promise
C  G/B  C     G/B  C       D
af-ter  that, I'll let you go

Em            D/F#        G
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
C        G/B C           G/B  C        D
All I really care is you wake up in my arms

Em    D/F#   G
One   last   time I need to
C  G/B C   G/B C         D
be the one who takes you home


[Verse 2]


Em         D/F#     G
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
    C            G/B C       G/B C                  D
But stay with me a   minute, I   swear I'll make it worth it

Em           D/F#     G
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
C                G/B C         G/B C                     D
I know that this is  my fault, I   should have been more careful


[Pre-Chorus]

      Em                D/F#                 G
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything but boy, I couldn't
C            G/B C     G/B C        D
give it   to       you

      Em                D/F#                G
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything but I got nothing
C            G/B C     G/B C        D
here    without    you


[Chorus]

   Em     D/F#   G

Em                    G

C                       G/B C                          G/B C
