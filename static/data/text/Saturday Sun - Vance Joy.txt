[Chorus]
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C          Em
Out on the West Coast
G                   D
I gotta get back I can't let this go
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C               Em
Don't care what it costs
                          C    Em  G  D
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

[Verse]
C           Em
So tired of sleepin' alone
G                  D
So tired of eatin' alone
C                 Em
I need to ask her what's goin' on
    G                 D
Are we goin' strong
C           Em
She fell I rested her head
   G                        D
My shoulder was the perfect height
          C
We fit so right
   Em                G                      D
So what's goin' on 'Cause I've been undone
[Pre-Chorus]
C                   Em
The long drive the coastline
G              D
Lookin' out at first light
C          Em
Am I still on her mind
G
I've been undone
[Chorus]
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C          Em
Out on the West Coast
G                   D
I gotta get back I can't let this go
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C               Em
Don't care what it costs
                          C    Em  G  D
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
C  Em G D
Ever lost
C      Em
Ba-ba ba-ba
G      D
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba
C      Em
Ba-ba ba-ba
G      D
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba
[Verse]
C             Em
And still the memory's right there
G                        D
She put the breeze in my hair
            C       Em
No kiss was softer softer than this
    G                D
I'm readin' her lips
[Pre-Chorus]
C              Em
Oh each night I read
G            D
She left her books in my bed
    C           Em
And her song in my head
G
I've been undone
[Chorus]
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C          Em
Out on the West Coast
G                   D
I gotta get back I can't let this go
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C               Em
Don't care what it costs
                          C    Em  G  D
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
C  Em G D
Ever lost
C      Em
Ba-ba ba-ba
G      D
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba
C      Em
Ba-ba ba-ba
G      D
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba
C   Em G D
Lost
C   Em G D
Lost
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
  D
I met someone
C          Em
Out on the West Coast
G                   D
I gotta get back I can't let this go

Oh Saturday Sun

C               Em
Don't care what it costs
                          C    Em  G  D
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
C   Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
C  Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun

I met someone
C  Em       G
Oh Saturday Sun
