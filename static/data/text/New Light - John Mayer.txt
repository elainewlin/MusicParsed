Dm  G  C  C


[Verse 1]
Dm                  G
I'm the girl in your other phone
C                       F              
Lighting up inside your drawer at home 
           Dm                   G
all alone. Pushing 20 in the friend zone
C                    F          
We talk and then you walk away 
           Dm                  G
every day. Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
C                E7                     
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

[Chorus]
Dm     G                      C
If you give me just one night
             F                     Dm
You're gonna see me in a new light
             G                     C
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            F              
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Dm                G                   C
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
                 F                    Dm
I wanna know the real thing about you
         G                     C  C
So I can see you in a new light

[Verse 2]
Dm                G
Take a ride up to Malibu
C                    F            
I just wanna stay to look at you, 
             Dm                           G
look at you. What would it matter if your friends knew?
C                    F         
Who cares what other people say anyway
Dm            G
Oh, we can go far from the end
C              E7                  Dm
And make a new world together baby

[Chorus]
              G                      C
'Cause if you give me just one night
             F                     Dm
You're gonna see me in a new light
             G                     C
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            F              
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Dm                G                   C
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
                 F                    Dm
I wanna know the real thing about you
         G                     C  C
So I can see you in a new light

[Bridge]
Dm  G  C  F

Dm  G  C  C
mmm       ah

[Chorus]
Dm     G                      C
If you give me just one night
             F                     Dm
You're gonna see me in a new light
             G                     C
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            F              
To meet you underneath the moonlight
