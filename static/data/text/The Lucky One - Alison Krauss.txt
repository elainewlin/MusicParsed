[Verse]
     G
You're the lucky one so I've been told
    D
As free as the wind blowin' down the road
    G
Loved by many hated by none
    C
I'd say you were lucky cause you know what you've done
       G
Not a care in the world not a worry in sight
  D
Everythings gonna be alright
               C        G
Cause you're the lucky one

[Verse]
    G
You're the lucky one always havin' fun
   D
A jack of all trades, a master of none
     G
You look at the world with a smilin' eye
    C
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by
   G
Give you a song and a one-night stand
   D
And you'll be lookin at a happy man
                  C     G
Cause you're the lucky one

[Chorus]
             Am
Well you're blessed I guess
          D
By never knowin' which road you're choosin'
           Am
To you the next best thing
                D          B          Em
To playin' and winnin' is playin and losin'

[Verse]
    G
You're the lucky one I know that now
      D
Don't ask you why when where or how
    G
You look at the world through your smilin' eye
     C
And laugh at the devil as the train goes by
 G
Give you a song and a one-night stand
  D
And you'll be lookin' at a happy man
                 C      G
Cause you're the lucky one

[Chorus]
            Am
Well you're blessed I guess,
           D
By never knowin' which road you're choosin'
           Am                              D
To you the next best thing to playin' and winnin'
    B           Em
Is playin' and losin'

[Verse]
           G
You're the lucky one I know that now
      D
Don't ask you why when where or how
            G
No matter where you're at that's where you'll be
        C
You can bet your luck won't follow me
  G
Give you a song and a one-night stand
     D
And you'll be lookin' at a happy man
            C         G
Cause you're the lucky one
