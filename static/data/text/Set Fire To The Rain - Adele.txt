Verse:
          Dm      F
I let it fall, my heart,
           C                    Bb
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
        Dm            F
It was dark and I was over,
           C                     Bb
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
    Dm             F
My hands, they're strong,
          C                Bb
but my knees were far too weak,
     Dm           F
To stand in your arms
          C               Bb
without falling to your feet,

Pre-Chorus:
               Bb                 Dm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          Bb                          Dm
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         Bb                            C
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

Chorus:
           Dm
But I set fire to the rain,
            C
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Bb
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Gm          C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,

Verse:
      Dm       F
When lay with you
          C           Bb
I could stay there, close my eyes,
          Dm     F
feel you here forever,
        C                        Bb
You and me together, nothing is better,

Pre-Chorus:
               Bb                 Dm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          Bb                          Dm
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         Bb                            C
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

Chorus:
           Dm
But I set fire to the rain,
            C
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Bb
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Gm          C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Dm
I set fire to the rain,
            C
And I threw us into the flames,
         Bb
Well, I felt something die,
                                      Gm             C
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,

Bridge:
          Dm                F
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
               C                        Bb
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you,
      Dm                     F
Even now when we're already over,
         C                        Bb
I can't help myself from looking for you,

Chorus:
           Dm
But I set fire to the rain,
            C
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Bb
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Gm          C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Dm
I set fire to the rain,
            C
And I threw us into the flames,
         Bb
Well, I felt something die,
                                      Gm             C
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,
