F                  C
I could lift you up
        Am
I could show you what you want to see
     G
and take you where you want to be

F                   C
You could be my luck
      Am
Even if the sky is falling down
   G
I know that we'll be safe and sound

F                    C
I could fill your cup
            Am
You know my river won't evaporate
      G
This world we still appreciate

F                   C
You could be my luck
          Am
Even in a hurricane of frowns
   G
I know that we'll be safe and sound

F                    C
I could show you love
     Am
In a tidal wave of mystery
        G
You'll still be standing next to me

F                   C
You could be my luck
        Am
Even if we're six feet underground
   G
I know that we'll be safe and sound
