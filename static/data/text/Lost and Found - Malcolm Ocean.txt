       C         Am
I got lost, and found
     F                          C        G
that I could no longer hear my favorite sounds
          C         Am                G
and so I wandered around... singing aloud


           F                  C
trying to capture all these thoughts
           Am                G
trying to master all these abilities
                F            C
learning to connect all the dots
          Am          Em   F   G   Am   G F C G
and cultivating possibilities


       C         Am
I got lost, and found
     F                         C                    G
that all my bright colors had turned to greys and browns
      C         Am         G
as I wandered around, downtown


           F               C
looking around at all the faces
     F                C
tryna recognize the places
                 Am                              G
their minds must be... to generate the shapes I see
     F                    C
simulate them on my own features
F                 C
the body is my teacher
             Am                           G
of how they feel: making these strangers real, to me

       C         Am
I got lost, and found
     F                                C            G
that I just couldn't seem to keep my feet on the ground
          C         Am           G
and so I wandered around, the clouds


       F         C
Tryna find my direction
            F                C
but I need a more direct connection
                  Am                                         G
with my terminal goals, to determine which road to point my soles to


     F                    C
Find a reason for all my actionsâ€”
F                 C
gain some better traction
                  Am                                   G
using fusion and fission... to align my hands with my vision...
                 Am
in every life decision...


Am                               Em Am
I found my map was not the territory
Am                               Em Am
at first, this was kinda scary for me
Am                                Em Am
but I know that living with uncertainty
Am                   E7                  Am
beats living with a false sense of security

Am                                                Em Am
so now the plan is to think on everything I think I know
Am                                       Em Am
and if it doesn't match the world to let it go
Am                                         Em  Am
putting what remains into creations like this song
Am                       E7                              Am
reminding me that I can never be quite right only Less Wrong

Am                          Em Am
So I seek out every opportunity
Am                                   Em Am
for creating and cultivating possibilities
Am                                           Em   Am
meeting with groups of people, with intersecting goals
Am                      E7                   Am
and integrating them into an interconnected whole
Am                                           Em   Am
the conversations get more and more and more abstract
Am                                                Em    Am
and meta and meta-meta and just like this they go off-track
Am                                                 Em Am
but in the end we're honing in on the world we wanna see
Am               E7                         Am
all intelligent beings... acting with empathy

I got lost, and found
       F                     C              G
I had so much to do, and so many questions how
         C          Am            G
but the wandering around... ends now
