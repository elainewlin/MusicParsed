Verse 1:

Ab2           Cm7                              Bbsus4        Bb
I see the place that we've been locked together, together

     Bbsus4   Bb         Ab2
Like we were something more

                 Cm7                         Bb        Bbsus4   Bb
And it felt like maybe we could last forever, forever

Pre Chorus:       
       
                       Ab/F
But you led 'em to our hideout

Forced their way inside, now

                 Bb                 Bbsus4    Bb
They want us to surrender, us to surrender

                   Ab
But I could go all night right here

              Eb/G
Between their crossfire

                     Bb
We'll send them up a message

              Bbsus4           Bb
I'll send the message saying "give it up, give it up"

Chorus:

Verse 2:

Ab2           Cm7                           Bbsus4       Bb
Wait for the dust to settle down around us, around us

    Bbsus4       Bb    Ab2
And stick to what we know

            Cm7                                  Bb                Bbsus4 
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again, to breathe again

Pre Chorus:

    Bb                Ab/F
The world is in your palm now

                     Eb
So take a breath and calm down

                      Bb                    Bbsus4    Bb
Cause you have been selected, you've been selected

  Bbsus4              Ab
A few will ever find out

                     Eb/G
And if you don't see why, well

                         Bb                         Bbsus4
At least you've got your nest egg, you've got your nest egg

So live it up, live it up!
