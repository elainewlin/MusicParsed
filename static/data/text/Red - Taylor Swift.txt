[Verse]
     
                    A                 C#m
Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
                B
Down a dead end street
A                           C#m
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
         B
Ended so suddenly
                    A
Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind 
            C#m                         B
Once you're already flying through the free fall
         A                  C#m
Like the colors in autumn so bright
                 B          
Just before they lose it all


[Chorus]

               A                    E
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                B
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   A                       C#m
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          B
You never met
                   A
But loving him was red
          C#m        B
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
               A
Lovin' him was red
          C#m        B
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed


[Verse]

                       A                      C#m
Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted 
                   B
Was right there in front of you
                       A                       C#m
Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
                    B
To your old favorite song
                           A 
Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a 
              C#m                           B
Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
                        A                        C#m
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out 
                       B
That love could be that strong 


[Chorus]

               A                    E
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                B
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   A                       C#m
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          B
You never met
                   A
But loving him was red
          C#m           B
Re ee ed, re ee ed, oh red, re ee ed
        A              C#m
Burnin' red, re ee ed, re ee ed
B
Re ee ed, 


[Bridge]

                         A               E
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
                    C#m             B
Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go 
                   A
But moving on from him is impossible 
     E                       B     
When I still see it all in my, head 
            A   C#m  B
And burning red
       A      C#m  B
Burning was reeeeed
  

[Chorus]

                  A                  E 
Oh losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                B              B 
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   A                       C#m
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody
          B
You never met
                     A
Cause loving him was red
C#m          B
Yeah, yeah, red
           A   C#m  B
Oh Burning reeeeeeeed


[Outro]

           A                  C#m              B
And that's Why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
                              A   
Comes back to me, burnin' red 
  C#m      B
Yeah, yeah

                   A                 C#m 
His love was like, drivin' a new Maserati
               B 
Down a dead end street.
