Fm        Eb      Db 


[Verse]

Fm        Eb      Db 
I want you by my side
Ab                    C7
So that I never feel alone again
Fm            Eb      Db 
They've always been so kind
Ab                           C7
But now they've brought you away from here
Fm          Eb             Db 
I hope they didn't get your mind
Ab                        C7  
Your heart is too strong anyway
Fm        Eb             Db 
We need to fetch back the time
Ab                     C7
They have stolen from us


[Chorus]

Db 
And I want you
Ab
We can bring it on the floor
             C7              Fm
You've never danced like this before
             Eb
But we don't talk about it
Db                  Ab
Dancin on doin the boogie all night long
C7          Fm
Stoned in paradise
Eb
Shouldn't talk about it

Db 
And I want you
Ab
We can bring it on the floor
             C7              Fm
You've never danced like this before
             Eb
But we don't talk about it
Db                  Ab
Dancin on doin the boogie all night long
C7          Fm
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
Ab                 C7  
No sun is shining anymore
Fm        Eb      Db  
The only thing I feel is pain
Ab                 C7  
Caused by absence of you
Fm        Eb      Db  
Suspence is controlling my mind 
Ab                 C7 
I cannot find the way out of here
Fm        Eb      Db  
I want you by my side

So that i never feel alone again
