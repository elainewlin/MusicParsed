[Chorus]
G          C                         E7
Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby 
        F                             G
Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around 
         C                               E7
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby 
         F                               G
When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still 
       C                          C7
I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin' 
    F                         Fm
You know that I have from the start 
   C           G
So build me up Buttercup, 
                    F F C Dm C G7
Don't break my heart 

[Verse 1]
          C       G                Bb       F                          
"I'll be over at ten," you told me time and again 
             C          F
But you're late, I wait around and then 
  C           G             Bb       F             
I went to the door, I can't take any more 
         C               F
It's not you, you let me down again

[Bridge]
 F         Dm                G7
(Hey, hey, hey!) Baby, baby, try to find 
 G7        Em                      A7
(Hey, hey, hey!) A little time and I'll make you mine 
Dm              
I'll be home 
        D7                           G
I'll be beside the phone waiting for you 
G           
Ooo-oo-ooo, ooo-oo-ooo

[Verse 2]
   C         G         Bb           F          
To you I'm a toy but I could be the boy you 
 C                    F
Adore, if you'd just let me know 
   C            G 
Although you're untrue, 
    Bb           F           C
I'm attracted to you all the more 
         F
Why do I need you so
