[Verse]

C      B7              G#   G
 Stars shining bright above you;
C      B7              A          A7
 Night breezes seem to whisper I love you.
F                     Fm
 Birds singing in the sycamore tree.
C               G#    G  C G
 Dream a little dream of me.
C    B7               G#   G
 Say nighty-night and kiss me;
C     B7                A              A7
 Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me.
F                 Fm
 While I'm alone, blue as can be,
C              G#    G  C  E7
Dream a little dream of me.


[Chorus]

A      F#m        Bm       E
 Stars fading but I linger on, dear---
A      F#m       Bm       E
 Still craving your kiss.
A    F#m        Bm           E
 I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear,
A     F#m    G# G
 Just saying this...


[Verse]

C      B7                   G#   G
 Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you---
C      B7                    A         A7
 Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.
F                        Fm
 But in your dreams, whatever they be,
C              G#    G  C  G
Dream a little dream of me.

 Still craving your kiss.
A    F#m        Bm           E
 I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear,
A     F#m    G# G
 Just saying this...
