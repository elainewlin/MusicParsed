
[Verse 1]

Am                   G
 Getting born in the state of Mississippi,
    Dm                         Am 
Her Poppa was a copper and her Momma was a hippie
Am          G
 In Alabama she would swing a hammer,
Dm                           Am  
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
Am         G                   Dm       Am
 She never knew that there was anything more than poor,
Am           G               Dm      Am
 What in the world does your company take me for?


[Verse 2]

Am             G    
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana,
Dm                           Am 
Robbin' all the banks in the state of Indiana,
Am               G
 She's a runner, rebel and a stunner,
Dm                           Am
Condemned everywhere sayin, 'baby whatcha gonna'
Am                G           Dm         Am      
  Lookin down the barrel of a hot metal .45,
Am             G          Dm 
  Just another way to survive


[Chorus]

     F       C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
 G    F       C  Dm
Simultaneous release,
  G F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
      G  F          C          Dm 
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]

Am              G               
 She's a lover, baby and a fighter,
Dm                             Am
Shoulda seen it coming when it got a little brighter,
Am                 G 
 With a name like "Dani California",
Dm                      Am
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya,
Am        G              Dm        Am
 A little loaded she was stealing another breath
Am         G         Dm 
 I love my baby to death


[Chorus]

     F       C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
 G    F       C Dm
Simultaneous release,
  G F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
      G  F          C          Dm 
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah


[Bridge]

Bm            G     D           F#
 Who knew the other side of you?
Bm             G      D             F#       
 Who knew that others died to prove?
Bm           G       D         F#
 Too true to say goodbye to you
Bm            
 Too true, too sad, sad, sad


[Verse 3]

Am               G
 Push the fader, gifted animator,
Dm                   Am 
One for the now and eleven for the later,
Am             G                                  
 Never made it up to Minnesota,
Dm                     Am 
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Am           G                Dm         Am
 Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last,
Am       G              Dm         E7 
 It only hurts when I laugh;  gone too fast


[Chorus]

 G    F       C Dm

California, show your teeth,
      G  F          C          Dm  
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

    F       C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
  G  F   C     Dm
Simultaneous release,
  G F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
      G  F          C          Dm  
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
