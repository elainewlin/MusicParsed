Am                    G
Getting born in the state of Mississippi,
Dm                              Am 
Her Poppa was a copper and her Momma was a hippy,
Am           G
In Alabama she will swing a hammer,
Dm                     Am  
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama,
Am          G                  Dm                 Am
She never knew that there was anything more than all,
Am               G           Dm               Am
Well in the war your comfort to take me for,
 Am               G    
Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana,
 Dm                        Am 
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana,
 Am                 G
She's a runner, Rebel and a stunner,
 Dm                       Am
Come to Mirawais saying "Baby watcha gona?",
 Am          G                     Dm       Am      
Looking down the barrell of a hot bell 45,
 Am              G          Dm
Just another way to survive

[Chorus]

     F        C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
     F     C     Dm
Simultaneous release,
     F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
            F         C          Dm
She's my priestess, I'm your priest,
Dm 
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
          Am      G               
She's a lover, Baby and a fighter,
    Dm                         Am
Shoulda seen it coming when I got a little brighter,
Am                      G 
With a name like "Dani California",
 Dm                    Am
Day was gona come when I was gona mourn ya,
Am             G  
A little low,
                Dm              Am
That she was stealing another bread,
  Am
I love my baby to death


[Chorus]

     F        C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
     F     C     Dm
Simultaneous release,
     F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
            F         C          Dm
She's my priestess, I'm your priest,
Dm 
Yeah, yeah


[Bridge]

 Bm             G     F#
Who knew the hardest side of you?
 Bm             G     F#
Who knew the hardest time to prove?
 Bm          G      F#
Too true to say goodbye to you
 Bm            
Too true to say, say, say

[Verse 3]
 
   Am               G
Pushed the fader, Gifted animator,
 Dm                   Am 
One for the now, And eleven for the later,
  Am          G                                  
Never made it up to Minnesota,
 Dm                      Am 
Off the coated man, Was gona fill the quota,
 Am              G             Dm       Am
Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last,
 Am
It only hurts when I laugh,
         G
Gone to fade


[Chorus]


     F        C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
     F     C     Dm
Simultaneous release,
     F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
            F         C          Dm
She's my priestess, I'm your priest,
Dm 
Yeah, yeah


     F        C       Dm  
California, Rest In Peace,
     F     C     Dm
Simultaneous release,
     F       C         Dm
California, show your teeth,
            F         C          Dm
She's my priestess, I'm your priest,
Dm 
Yeah, yeah
