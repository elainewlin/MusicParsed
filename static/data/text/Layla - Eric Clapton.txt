[Verse 1]

C#m                            G# 
 What will you do when you get lonely?
C#m    C       D       E      
No one waiting by your side
F#m         B           E               A
You've been runnin' and hiding much too long
F#m           B                 E
You know it's just your foolish pride


[Chorus]

Dm            C         Dm
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Dm         C          Dm
Layla, I'm beggin' darling please
   Dm  C              Dm                 Dm    C              
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?  


[Verse 2]

C#m                       G# 
I tried to give you consolation
C#m      C      D       E      
Your old man he let you down
F#m    B       E                 A
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
F#m           B                  E 
You turned my whole world upside down


[Chorus]

Dm            C         Dm
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Dm         C          Dm
Layla, I'm beggin' darling please
   Dm  C              Dm                 Dm    C              
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?  

[Verse 3]

C#m                    G# 
  Make the best of the situation
C#m      C       D    E      
Before I finally go insane
F#m          B         E            A
Please don't say we'll never find a way
F#m     B                E
Tell me all my love's in vain


[Chorus]

Dm            C         Dm
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Dm         C          Dm
Layla, I'm beggin' darling please
   Dm  C              Dm                 Dm    C              
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?  

Dm            C         Dm
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Dm         C          Dm
Layla, I'm beggin' darling please
   Dm  C                                 Dm    C    
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
