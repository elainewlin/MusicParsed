Am                   F                  C
If I could face them, if I could make amends with all my shadows
Am          F            C
I'd bow my head and welcome them
Am                    F                      C
But I feel it burning, like when the winter wind stops my breathing
                                       Am             F              C
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone, fear you won't, I fear you don't

       F               Am                   G
And it echoes when I breathe, 'til all you see is my ghost
       F               Am                    G
Empty vessel, crooked teeth, wish you could see, and they call me under

F         C             Am             G
And I'm shaking like a leaf, and they call me under
F      C           Am              G
And I wither underneath, in this storm



Am              F           C
I am a stranger, I am an alien inside a structure
                                       Am                 F                C
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone, with all my thoughts, and all my faults
Am               F                     C
I feel it biting, I feel it break my skin so uninviting
                                       Am               F              C
Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone, I fear you won't, I fear you don't

       F               Am                   G
And it echoes when I breathe, 'til all you see is my ghost
       F               Am                    G
Empty vessel, crooked teeth, wish you could see, and they call me under

F         C             Am             G
And I'm shaking like a leaf, and they call me under
F      C           Am              G
And I wither underneath, in this storm, I feel it
F         C            Am                       F
And they call me under, and I'm shaking like a leaf
          C            Am             G
And they call me underneath, to the storm
