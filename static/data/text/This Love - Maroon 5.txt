[Verse 1]

G                      Cm
I was so high I didn't recognize
          Fm                                  G
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind....
G                            Cm
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
          Fm                           G
Never to return again but always in my heart

[Chorus]

Cm   Fm      A#7         D#
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         A#7            D#
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        A#7           D#
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    A#7                D#      G    Cm    Fm     G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]

G                           Cm
I tried my best to feed her appetite
                Fm                                  
Keep her coming every night
                    G                            
So hard to keep her satisfied
                              Cm 
Kept playing love like it was just a game
              Fm
Pretending to feel the same
                     G
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]

Cm   Fm      A#7         D#
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         A#7            D#
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        A#7           D#
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    A#7                D#      G    Cm    Fm     G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]

 Fm
I'll fix these broken things
  D#
Repair your broken wings
G7                          Cm  
And make sure everything's alright

My pressure on your hips
D#
Sinking my fingertips
G
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]

This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         A#7            D#
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        A#7           D#
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    A#7                D#      G    Cm    Fm     G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore
