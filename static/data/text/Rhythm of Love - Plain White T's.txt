CAPO 1 
[Verse 1]

G                       D
My head is stuck in the clouds
G                   D
She begs me to come down
     Em        D       C
Says "Boy quit foolin' around"
D            G                       D
I told her "I love the view from up here
G                           D
The warm sun and wind in my ear
      Em        D          C
We'll watch the world from above
      D            D         G     G7
As it turns to the rhythm of love"


[Chorus]

       C         G
We may only have tonight
             C                  G      B7 Em
But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
          D    C       D             D     G
Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love

[Verse 2]

G                     D
My heart beats like a drum
G                      D
A guitar string to the strum
  Em        D          C
A beautiful song to be sung
D          G                      D
She's got, blue eyes deep like the sea
G                                     D
That roll back when she's laughing at me
    Em    D           C
She rises up like the tide
    D        D           G    G7
The moment her lips meet mine


[Chorus]

       C            G
We may only have tonight
             C                 G       B7 Em
But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
          D     C       D           D        G
Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love

[Bridge]

B7       C       G   D
When the moon is low
B7      C       G    D    C
We can dance in slow motion
C             D             C
And all your tears will subside
C        D           G
All your tears.......will dry

 G          D      G             D
Bah-bah-(ba-ba) bah bah – Bah-bah-(ba-ba)- Bah bah                               
Em            D               C    D          
Daaah – dada,  dum - da da, Dum  
 G          D      G             D
Bah-bah-(ba-ba) bah bah – Bah-bah-(ba-ba)- Bah bah                               
Em            D               C    D          
Daaah – dada,  dum - da da, Dum  

G                   D
And long after I've gone
G                       D
You'll still be humming along
    Em       D         C
And I will keep you in my mind
     D     D              G     G7
The way you make love so fine


[Chorus]

       C            G
We may only have tonight
             C                  G     B7  Em
But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
          D     C       D     D             G
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
D
Ohh
Em       D      C       D           D        G
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love


[Outro]

Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love
