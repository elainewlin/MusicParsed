[Verse 1]
    Em G      D C
Hello,  it's me
       Em          G                D
I was wondering if after all these years
               C          Em  G       D  C
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
               Em                 G
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
             D         C
But I ain't done much healing

[Verse 2]
    Em G         D     C
Hello,  can you hear me?
        Em          G              D             C
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
              Em    G      D C
When we were younger and free
      Em               G               D                 C
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
                Em   D        Bm  C
There's such a difference between us
       Em  D   C
And a million miles

[Chorus]
 Em          C        G  D
Hello from the other side
   Em                C       G   D
I must've called a thousand times
         Em      C                G              D
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em       C     G          D
But when I call you never seem to be home
 Em          C     G  D
Hello from the outside
    Em               C         G  D
At least I can say that I've tried
         Em      C           G            D
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em       C              G         D       Em G D C
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 3]
    Em G    D    C
Hello,  how are you?
         Em         G           D           C
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
   Em G             D  C
I hope that you're well
        Em           G                       D            C
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
         Em   D          Bm     C       Em     D       C
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time

[Chorus]
 Em          C        G  D
Hello from the other side
   Em                C       G   D
I must've called a thousand times
         Em      C                G              D
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em       C     G          D
But when I call you never seem to be home
 Em          C     G  D
Hello from the outside
    Em               C         G  D
At least I can say that I've tried
         Em      C           G            D
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em       C              G         D       Em C
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
 D  G        Em C
Ooooohh, anymore
 D  G        Em C
Ooooohh, anymore
 D  G        Em C
Ooooohh, anymore
    D  G
Anymore

[Chorus]
 Em          C        G  D
Hello from the other side
   Em                C       G   D
I must've called a thousand times
         Em      C                G              D
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em       C     G          D
But when I call you never seem to be home
 Em          C     G  D
Hello from the outside
    Em      C                  G  D
At least I can say that I've tried
         Em      C           G            D
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em       C              G         D       Em G D C Em
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
