Verse:
          Dm     G          C
Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face,
            Dm       G                C
People have told me, I don't look the same,
        Dm          G           C
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky,
                     Dm                         G                         C
With the best of the best, put your heart on my chest so that you can see it too,
 
 
Pre-Chorus:
                F        Fm             C         Am
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
                 Dm               D            G
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?
 
Chorus:
               Am        D        F                  C
The death of a bachelor, oh oh oh, letting the water fall,
               Am        D        F                 C
The death of a bachelor, oh oh oh, seems so fitting for,
             Am     D   F                    C
Happily ever after, ooh, how could I ask for more?
              Am       D                     F          C
a lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor
 
 
Verse:
               Dm      G                 C
I'm cutting my mind off, It feel like my heart is going to burst,
           Dm                G               C
Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served,
             Dm         G          C
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
               Dm             G                        C
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad.
 
 
Pre-Chorus:
                F        Fm             C         Am
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall,
                 Dm               D            G
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?
 
 
Chorus:
               Am        D        F                  C

The death of a bachelor, oh oh oh, seems so fitting for,
