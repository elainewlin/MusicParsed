      Cmaj7         Dm 
I was fine with the men

          Cmaj7         G7           Cmaj7
Who would come into her life now and again.

      Dm            D   
I was fine 'cause I knew

                 Dm7    G7           Cmaj7 
That they didn't really matter until you.  

      Cmaj7         Dm  
I was fine when you came

       Cmaj7              G7             Cmaj7
And we fought like it was all some silly game

     Dm             D      
Over her, who she'd choose.

      Dm7                G7                Cmaj7
After all those years, I never thought I'd lose.

     Cmaj7           C7        Dm       G7   
It's over, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it over?

     C               C7        A7       Dm   
It's over, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it over?

    Dm7          G                  Cmaj7                A7   
You won, and she chose you, and she loved you, and she's gone.

     Dm7             G7               Cmaj7  C    E7
It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on?         

Am      E      C   D      
War and glory, reinvention

Dm      Am       F#dim  E        
Fusion, freedom, her   attention,

Am     E         C    D       
Out in daylight, my potential,

Dm       Am    F#dim  E          
Bold, precise, ex-----perimental,

Am       E           C         D       
Who am I now in this world without her?

Dm        Am            F#dim    E         
Petty and dull with the nerve to doubt her?

Am           E            C       D    
What does it matter, it's already done.

         Dm                      G7  
Now I've got to be there for her son.

     Cmaj7           C7        Dm       G7   
It's over, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it over?

     C               C7        A7       Dm   
It's over, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it over?

    Dm7          G                  Cmaj7                A9   
You won, and she chose you, and she loved you, and she's gone.

     Dm7             G7               Cmaj7   A7
It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on?     

     Dm              Dbmaj7           
It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on?
