[Verse]
        Am                        Em                 F
Now I'm of consenting age to be forgetting you in a cabaret. 
        Am                                      Em         F
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen may even ask my name 
       Am                                               
As she sheds her skin on stage
     Em                       F
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's P.A.
Am                              
The strip joint veteran sits two away 
Em                     F                          Am    C   Bm       F
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified peach and lime daiquiri 

[Chorus]
Am        C            F              
And isn't this exactly where you'd like me 
    Dm                                 F
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
            Em         Dm             
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety 
Am            C            F              
Oh, and isn't this exactly where you'd like me 
    Dm                                 F
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
            Em         Am             
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety 

Oh......

[Verse]
But I'm afraid that I 
Well, I may of faked it
    Am                   Em                F   
And I wouldn't be caught dead, dead, dead, dead in this place
      Am            Em  
Well, I'm afraid that I
            F            
That's right well, that I may have faked it 
Am             Em        F (ring out)
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place 

[Chorus]
Am        C            F              
And isn't this exactly where you'd like me 
    Dm                                 F
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
            Em         Dm             
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety 
Am            C            F              
Oh, and isn't this exactly where you'd like me 
    Dm                                 F
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
            Em         Am             
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety

[Solo]
Am, Am, Dm, Dm, F, F   x2

      Am          Bm
Well, I'm afraid that I
        F
Well, I may of faked it                                     
     Am           Bm     F
And I wouldn't be caught dead, dead, dead, dead, dead in this place   x2
 
[Chorus]
Am        C            F              
And isn't this exactly where you'd like me 
    Dm                                 F
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
            Em         Dm             
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety 
Am            C            F              
Oh, and isn't this exactly where you'd like me 
    Dm                                 F
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
            Em         Dm             
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety
Dm
Praying for love and paying in naivety
Dm 
Praying for love and paying in naivety
     Am
.......oh.
