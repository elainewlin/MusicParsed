Sittin' in the mornin' sun,
        C                   B Bb A
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes.
G                       B
Watching the ships roll in,
       C               B Bb A
then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah.
Chorus:
    G                          E
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
             G          E
watching the tide roll away.
             G                          A
Oo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
        G     E
wastin' time.

I left my home in Georgia,
C                   B Bb A
headed for the 'Frisco Bay.
G                      B
I have nothing to live for,
C                   B Bb A
it look like nothin's gonna come my way.

Chorus:
    G                          E
So I’m just gonna sit on the dock of the bay,

watching the tide roll away.

Bridge:
G    D       C
Look like nothing's gonna change.
G  D   C
Ev'rything still remains the same.
G D             C               G
I can't do what ten people tell me to do,
F                 D
so I guess I'll remain the same, yes.

and this loneliness won't leave me alone.

It’s two thousand miles I roamed
G                      B
just to make this dock my home..

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
             G          E
watching the tide roll away.
             G                          A
Oo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
        G     E
wastin' time.
