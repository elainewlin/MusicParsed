No sir, well I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
      G                              A             Bm
It's your turn, so take a seat we're settling the final score
     G                 A       Bm  A
And why do we like to hurt, so much?
           G                        Bm
I can't decide, you have made it harder
         Bm        G                 A
Just to go on and why, all the possibilities
        Bm        Dx
Well, I was wrong


[Chorus]

G                             D                 Bm  A

  Bm                  A              Bm            A
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
G                                 D                 Bm   A

[Verse 2]

  G                 A                     Bm
I wonder, how am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
        G                       A               Bm
'Cause I burned every bridge I ever built whey you were here
   G                      A               Bm    
I still try holding onto silly things I never learn
   G                A             Bm               D(hold)

G                      A     Bm
Pain, make your way to me, to me
     G                  A       Bm
And I'll always be just so inviting
   G               A        Bm
If I ever start to think straight
     G
This heart will start a riot in me
A             Bm
Let's start, start, hey!
G                 A       Bm   A
Why do we like to hurt so much?
    G                  A    Bm   A
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
N.C.                                              A
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
