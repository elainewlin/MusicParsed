[Chorus]

 C                          Em
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
 C                          Em
Ah, look at all the lonely people.


[Verse]

Em
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice in the church
                     C                Em
where a weeding has been, lives in a dream.
Em
Waits at the window, wearing the face
                                C              Em
that she keeps in a jar by the door, who is it for?


[Bridge]

Em7            Em6
All the lonely people,
     C/E                Em
where do they all come from?
Em7            Em6
All the lonely people,
      C/E            Em
where do they all belong?


[Verse]

Em
Father McKenzie, writing the words
                     C                Em
of a sermon that no one will hear, no-one comes near.
Em
Look at him working, darning his socks
                                C              Em
in the night when thereâ€™s nobody there,what does he care?


[Chorus]

 C                          Em
All the lonely people,...
 C                          Em
Ah, look at all the lonely people....


[Verse]

Em
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
                     C                Em
and was buried along with her name, nobody came.
Em
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
                                C              Em
from his hands as he walks from the grave, no-one was seved.


[Outro]

 C                          Em
All the lonely people,...
