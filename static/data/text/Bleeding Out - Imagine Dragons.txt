
[Chorus]

Em           C
I'm bleeding out
          G                 D
So if the last thing that I do
   Em          C
Is bring you down
     G             D
I'll bleed out for you
     Em
So I bare my skin
      C
And I count my sins
      G                   D
And I close my eyes and I take it in
    Em        C
I'm bleeding out
    G                 D
I'm bleeding out for you
    Em
For you




[Verse]

         Em      C
When the day has come
          G           D
That I've lost my way around
        Em      C
And the seasons stop
    G                D
And hide beneath the ground
         Em        C
When the sky turns grey
    G             D
And everything is screaming
       Em    C
I will reach inside
        G                D
Just to find my heart is beating
       Em         C
Oh you tell me to hold on
       G          D
Oh you tell me to hold on
    Em           C
But innocence is gone
    G                 D
And what was right is wrong


[Chorus]

          Em         C
Cause I'm bleeding out
          G                 D
So if the last thing that I do
   Em         C
Is bring you down
     G             D
I'll bleed out for you
     Em
So I bare my skin
      C
And I count my sins
      G                   D
And I close my eyes and I take it in
    Em       C
I'm bleeding out
    G                D
I'm bleeding out for you
    Em
For you


[Verse]

         Em      C
When the hour is nigh
    G               D
And hopelessness is sinking in
        Em         C
And the wolves all cry
   G                   D
To fill the night with hollering
          Em       C
When your eyes are red
    G            D
And emptiness is all you know
         Em       C
With the darkness fed
G              D
I will be your scarecrow
Em             C
You tell me to hold on
       G          D
Oh you tell me to hold on
    Em           C
But innocence is gone
    G                 D
And what was right is wrong


[Chorus]

          Em       C
Cause I'm bleeding out
          G                 D
So if the last thing that I do
   Em        C
Is bring you down
     G             D
I'll bleed out for you
     Em
So I bare my skin
      C
And I count my sins
      G                   D
And I close my eyes and I take it in
    Em       C
I'm bleeding out
    G                D
I'm bleeding out for you
    Em
For you

[Chorus]

      Em           C
Cause I'm bleeding out
          G                 D
So if the last thing that I do
   Em        C
Is bring you down
     G             D
I'll bleed out for you
     Em
So I bare my skin
      C
And I count my sins
      G                   D
And I close my eyes and I take it in
    Em       C
I'm bleeding out
    G                D
I'm bleeding out for you
    Em
For you
