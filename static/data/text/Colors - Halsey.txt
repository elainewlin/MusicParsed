[Verse 1]

            Am                             F
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
              C                         G
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
            Am                            F
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
           C                                G
I hope you make it to the day you're twenty eight years old


[Pre-Chorus]

       Am                             F
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
       C                            G
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
       Am                                F
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
       C                                  Em
And I'm tearing through the pages and the ink


[Chorus]

              Am
Everything is blue
               F
His pills, his hands, his jeans
            C
And now I'm covered in the colors
     G
Pull apart at the seams
            Am       F
And it's blue
            C        G
And it's blue
              Am
Everything is grey
              F
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
             C
And now he's so devoid of color
         G
He don't know what it means
    Am       F
And he's blue
    C        G
And he's blue


[Verse 2]

           Am                             F
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
         C                         G
I know I've only felt religion when I lay with you
            Am                          F
You said you'll never be forgiven till your boys are too
          C                             G
I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you


[Pre-Chorus]

       Am                             F
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
       C                            G
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
       Am                                F
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
       C                                  Em
And I'm tearing through the pages and the ink


[Chorus]

              Am
Everything is blue
               F
His pills, his hands, his jeans
            C
And now I'm covered in the colors
     G
Pull apart at the seams
    Am       F
And it's blue
    C        G
And it's blue
              Am
Everything is grey
              F
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
             C
And now he's so devoid of color
         G
He don't know what it means
    Am       F
And he's blue
    C        G
And he's blue


[Bridge]

Am
You were red and you liked me because I was blue
F
But you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky
C
Then you decided purple
G
Just wasn't for you


[Chorus]

              Am
Everything is blue
               F
His pills, his hands, his jeans
            C
And now I'm covered in the colors
     G
Pull apart at the seams
  Am       F
And it's blue
  C        G
And it's blue
              Am
Everything is grey
              F
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
             C
And now he's so devoid of color
         G
He don't know what it means
  Am       F
And he's blue
  C        G
And he's blue


[Outro]

      Am       F
Everything is blue
      C        G
Everything is blue
      Am       F
Everything is blue
      C        G
Everything is blue
