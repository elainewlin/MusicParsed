      Cmaj7            Dm         E7     
[Greg] Bright sunny day don't cost nothing

Am                  Bb         C7     
Light summer breeze don't cost nothing

F                 Em       A7    
What do I do with all this money?

         Dm                   G7 
When the only thing I want is you

Cmaj7          Dm         E7     
Palling around don't cost nothing

Am             Bb         C7     
Singing a song don't cost nothing

F              Em       A7    
How do I spend all this money?

    Dm                G7        Cmaj7
I'd rather just spend time with you

[Steven] You could buy a house and a car

                      Fmaj7                      Dm 
[Greg] I guess that I can but I've already got a van

                        Gm7    
I could put you through college

                                       C7  
[Steven] But I'm with the Gems all the time

                          Fmaj7                    F7  
[Greg] Or I could buy you all the finest courses online

                           Bbmaj7
[Steven] What if we took a trip?

[Greg] Do you think?

                C7                    Fmaj7 
[Steven] Yeah I do! We could take a vacation

                      Bbmaj7
We could go somewhere new
