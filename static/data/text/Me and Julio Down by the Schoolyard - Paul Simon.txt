    G
The mama pajama rolled out of bed,
                          C
and she ran to the police station
         D
When the papa found out, he began to shout,
                          G
and he started the investigation

                 D
It's against the law;
                   G
it was against the law
              D
What the mama saw;
                   G
it was against the law

    G
The mama looked down and spit on the ground,
                        C
every time my name gets mentioned
    D
The papa said oy, if I get that boy,
                                      G
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

               C
Well I'm on my way;
             G
I don't know where I'm going
          C                  G
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time;
      A7         D
but I don't know where
           C          F          G
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
       G      F
Seeing me and Julio,
C           D     G C G D
down by the schoolyard
       G      F
Seeing me and Julio,
C           D     G C G D
down by the schoolyard

Whoa, in a couple of days, they come and take me away,
                            C
but the press let the story leak
             D
Now when the radical priest, come to get me released,
                           G

               C
Well I'm on my way;
             G
I don't know where I'm going
          C                  G
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time;
      A7         D
but I don't know where
