[Verse 1]
             Am                  F
That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
    C                                      G
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
                  Am                   F
It’s buried in my soul like California gold
    C                                     G
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find


[Chorus]
            F
So when I'm all choked up
                     C
And I can't find the words
      Am
Every time we say goodbye
         G
Baby, it hurts
         F   G    Am
When the sun goes down
        F    G     C
And the band won't play
     F       G               C
I'll always remember us this way


[Verse 2]
              Am
Lovers in the night
                F
Poets trying to write
   C
We don't know how to rhyme
            G
But damn we try
                 Am
But all I really know
                     F
You're where I wanna go
    C                                G
The part of me that's you will never die


[Chorus]
            F
So when I'm all choked up
                     C
And I can't find the words
      Am
Every time we say goodbye
         G
Baby, it hurts
         F   G    Am
When the sun goes down
        F    G     C
And the band won't play
     F       G               Bb
I'll always remember us this way


[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
F                                     C Bb F G
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, oooh


[Chorus]
            F
So when I'm all choked up
                     C
And I can't find the words
      Am
Every time we say goodbye
         G
Baby, it hurts
         F   G    Am
When the sun goes down
        F    G     C
And the band won't play
     F       G               Am
I'll always remember us this way


[Outro]
         F   G  Am
When you look at me
        F     G     C
And the whole world fades
     F       G                  F  Bb F  C
I'll always remember us this way
