[Verse 1]

G          D/F#
Summer has come and passed
    Em           D
The innocent can never last
C               Cm        G
Wake me up when September ends

G                D/F#
Like my fathers' come to pass
Em              D
Seven years has gone so fast
C               Cm        G    D/F#
Wake me up when September ends


[Chorus]

Em             Bm
Here comes the rain again
C                G     D/F#
Falling from the stars
Em             Bm
Drenched in my pain again
C               D
Becoming who we are

G         D/F#
As my memory rests
    Em            D
But never forgets what I lost
C               Cm        G
Wake me up when September ends


[Verse 2]

G          D/F#
Summer has come and passed
    Em           D
The innocent can never last
C               Cm        G 
Wake me up when September ends

G            D/F#
Ring out the bells again
Em               D
Like we did when spring began
C               Cm        G    D/F#
Wake me up when September ends


[Chorus]

Em             Bm
Here comes the rain again
C                G     D/F#
Falling from the stars
Em             Bm
Drenched in my pain again
C               D
Becoming who we are

G         D/F#
As my memory rests
    Em            D
But never forgets what I lost
C          Cm             G    D/F#
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass

Twenty years has gone so fast

Wake me up when September ends
