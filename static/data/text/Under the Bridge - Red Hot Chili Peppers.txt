E           B            C#m         A
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
E           B         C#m     A
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
       E      B            C#m     A
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
E         B       C#m       A            Emaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

  E            B             C#m         A
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
  E                B               C#m         A
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
    E            B             C#m       A
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
E             B          C#m       A              Emaj7
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus]
F#m             E       B          F#m
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
F#m                    E     B           F#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
F#m             E        B         F#m
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
F#m                   E      B           F#m           
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, 
E    B        C#m      A
yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
E              B                  C#m    A
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
E              B          C#m      A
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
     E          B             C#m       A
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
E         B       C#m       A      Emaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

[Chorus]
F#m             E       B          F#m
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
F#m                    E     B           F#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
F#m             E        B         F#m
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
F#m                   E      B           F#m           
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, 
E    B        C#m      A
yeah, yeah, yeah

A   Am          G      F
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
A    Am         G     F
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
A            Am                G         F    
----------------One time

[Verse 3]
A                Am
Under the bridge downtown
G          F       
Is where I drew some blood
A                Am
Under the bridge downtown
G           F
I could not get enough

A                Am
Under the bridge downtown
G          F
Forgot about my love
A                Am
Under the bridge downtown
G         F
I gave my life away

A  Am  G    F   
Yeah yeah yeah
A   Am          G    F
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
