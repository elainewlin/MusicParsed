[Intro] 

Dm        C Gm Dm
Life is a mystery
              C     Gm  F
Everyone must stand a - lone
           C    Bb F
I hear you call my name
Bb     F     C    Dm 
And it feels like home


[Chorus]

F                C
When you call my name
                   Bb 
It's like a little prayer
               F
I'm down on my knees
        C    C7  F
I wanna take you there
                C
In the midnight hour
                Bb
I can feel your power
            F
Just like a prayer
              C    C7  F
You know I'll take you there


[Verse]
Bb          F
I hear your voice
C            Dm
It's like an angel sighing
Bb        F                  C       
I have no choice I hear your voice
C
Feels like flying
Bb         F
I close my eyes
C        Dm
Oh God I think I'm falling
Bb         F              C       
Out of the sky I close my eyes
C
Heaven help me


[Chorus]


[Verse]
       F
Like a child
C           Dm
You whisper softly to me
Bb        F                   C       
You're in control just like a child
C
Now I'm dancing
Bb          F
It's like a dream
C          Dm
No end and no beginning
Bb               F              C
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing


[Chorus]
[Chorus]

F                C
When you call my name

I'm down on my knees
        C    C7  F
I wanna take you there
                C
In the midnight hour
                Bb
I can feel your power

Just like a prayer

Life is a mystery
Dm            C         Dm 
Everyone must stand a - lone

Just like a muse to me, you are a mistery
