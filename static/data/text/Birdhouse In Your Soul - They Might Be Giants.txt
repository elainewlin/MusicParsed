C             Bb                 Eb
I'm your only friend- I'm not your only friend
    F            Bb
But I'm a little glowing friend
    Cm             Db            G
But really I'm not actually your friend, but I am

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch

Who watches over you
C      G    F              Eb
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
               Ab
Not to put too fine a point on it
Eb               Ab
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Eb     Cm     Ab        G       C
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I have a secret to tell from my electrical well
C      G    C7              F               G
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
C                F             C          F
So the room must listen to me, filibuster vigilantly
C  G     C7          F                  G
My name is blue canary one note spelled l-i-t-e

Am        F
My story's infinite
D7                F              G
Like the longines symphonette it doesn't rest

Make a little birdhouse in your soul

[Verse 2]
C                 F           C               F
There's a picture opposite me of my primitive ancestry
C     G      C7               F                G
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
C          F                 C               F
Though I respect that a lot, I'd be fired if that were my job
C     G     C7            F                   G
After killing Jason off and countless screaming argonauts

Am          F
Bluebird of friendliness
D7            F          G
Like guardian angels its always near

While you're at it, keep the nightlight on inside

the birdhouse in your soul
Eb             Ab
Not to put too fine a point on it
