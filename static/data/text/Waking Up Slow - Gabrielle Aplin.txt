CAPO 1
[Verse 1]
C5
Heaven help me
My mind changes like the wind
Please excuse me
I don't know where to begin
    Bbadd2
But I
                     Dm
Didn't think I cared
                       C
I could be your friend
But I'm unprepared
    C               F/A  Bbsus2
Oh, I've never felt like this
              Dm
I was unaware
                         Cadd4
You were lighting flares
                       C
Now I'm running scared
    C               F/A  Gmadd4
Oh, how did it come to   this?


[Pre-Chorus]
              F
You know I've never
        Dm7       F  C
Been so lonely on my own
       Gm
And it shows
              F
'Cause I don't see you
        Dm
Like I used to
N.C
Now I'm going back on the things that I know


[Chorus]
F
Oh
    Dm  C
All my nights
      Am   Bb
Taste like gold
               Bb
Yeah, when I'm with you
                     F
It's like everything glows
        Dm  C
And all my days
       Am  Bb
We can lay low
                 Dm7add4     
Yeah, when we're waking up
      C         Bbadd2
We're waking up slow


[Verse 2]
Bb               Dm
I can rearrange
                       Cadd4
Would you do the same?

I don't wanna change
                         F6/A    Bbadd2
But you're just too good to miss
                       Dm7
'Cause I'm intertwined
                      Cadd4
And I'm running blind
But I don't mind
                    F/A  Gm
I'm so glad it came to   this


[Pre-Chorus]
              Fadd2
You know I've never
        Dm7       F  C
Been so lonely on my own
       Gm
And it shows
               F
'Cause I don't see you
        Dm7 
Like I used to
N.C
Now I'm going back on the things that I know


[Chorus]
F
Oh
    Dm  C
All my nights
      Am   Bb
Taste like gold
               Bb
Yeah, when I'm with you
                     F
It's like everything glows
        Dm  C
And all my days
       Am  Bb
We can lay low
                 Dm7add4     
Yeah, when we're waking up
       C        F
We're waking up slow


[Post-Chorus]
                  Dm7          C
It's a little bit clearer now
                    F/A      Bb
I love you like the sun came out
Oh
      Bb
We're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow
                  Dm7          C
It's like I never had a doubt
                    F/A      Bb
I love you like the sun came out
Oh
      Dm7add4
We're waking up
      Cadd4
We're waking up


[Bridge]
Bb          F/A
Like I told ya
Bb             C     Dm
Don't look backwards
'Cause now I see you here
Fmaj9
 Nothing else matters
Bb          F/A
Like I told ya
Bb             C     Dm
Don't look backwards
'Cause now I see you here
N.C
I'm going back on the things that I know


[Chorus]
F
Oh
    Dm  C
All my nights
      Am   Bb
Taste like gold
               Bb
Yeah, when I'm with you
                     F
It's like everything glows
        Dm  C
And all my days
       Am  Bb
We can lay low
                 Dm7add4     
Yeah, when we're waking up
       C        F
We're waking up slow


[Post-Chorus]
                  Dm7          C
It's a little bit clearer now
                    F/A      Bb
I love you like the sun came out
Oh
      Bb
We're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow
                  Dm7          C
It's like I never had a doubt
                    F/A      Bb
I love you like the sun came out
Oh
      Dm
We're waking up
      Cadd4
We're waking up
