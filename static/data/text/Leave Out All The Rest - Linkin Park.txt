
[Verse One]

                Am
I dreamed I was missing
            C
You were so scared.
                 Fmaj7
But no one would listen
                 G
Cuz' no one else cared.

          Am
After my dreaming
                 C
I woke with this fear.
          Fmaj7
What am I leaveing,
               G
When I am done here?


[Chorus]

              Am         C           G
So if you're asking me I want you to know...
        Am
When my time comes
                      C
Forget the wrong that i've done
                 Fmaj7                 G
Help me leave behind some reason to be missed.
            Am
And don't resent me
                        C
And when you're feeling empty
                Fmaj7
Keep me in your memory
                  G                      Am
Leave out all the rest,Leave out all the rest.


[Verse Two]

          C
Don't be afraid
              Fmaj7
I've taken my beating
                   G
I've shared what I made.

                  Am
I'm strong on the surface
                C
Not all the way through.
                Fmaj7
I've never been perfect
                 G
But neither have you.


[Chorus]

             Am          C           G
So if you're asking me I want you to know...
        Am
When my time comes
                      C
Forget the wrong that i've done
                Fmaj7                  G
Help me leave behind some reason to be missed.
            Am
And don't resent me
                        C
And when you're feeling empty
                Fmaj7
Keep me in your memory
                  G                      Fmaj7
Leave out all the rest,Leave out all the rest.


[Bridge]

Forgetting
        G                                     Fmaj7
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well.
Pretending
        G                                Fmaj7
Someone else can come and save me from myself.
                   G
I can't be who you are...


[Chorus]

        Am
When my time comes
                      C
Forget the wrong that i've done
                Fmaj7                  G
Help me leave behind some reason to be missed.
            Am
And don't resent me
                        C
And when you're feeling empty
                Fmaj7
Keep me in your memory
                  G                      Fmaj7
Leave out all the rest,Leave out all the rest.


[Bridge]

Forgetting
        G                                     Fmaj7
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well.

Pretending
        G                                Fmaj7
Someone else can come and save me from myself.
                   G                 Fmaj7
I can't be who you are
                   G
I can't be who you are.
