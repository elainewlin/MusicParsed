[Verse]

B             F#sus4  F#/C#
Little child, be not afraid

    A                    E
The rain pounds harshly against the glass

        G#m               B/F#
like an unwanted stranger, there is no danger,

E
I am here tonight

B             F#
Little child, be not afraid,

       A                    E         E/B
though thunder explodes and lightning flash

G#m         B/F#
illuminates your tear-stained face

E                  F#
I am here tonight

[Chorus]
                      B                  E
And someday you'll know that nature is so

         C#m                      F#
the same rain that draws you near me

                        B                      E
falls on rivers and land, on forests and sand

          G#m                         F#
makes the beautiful world that you see

       E
in the morning

B             F#sus4   F#/C#
Little child, be not afraid

       A                        E
though storm clouds mask your beloved moon

        G#m                      B/F#
and its candlelight beams, still keep pleasant dreams

E
I am here tonight

B             F#
Little child, be not afraid

       A                    E      E/B
though wind makes creatures of our trees

          G#m                            B/F#
and their branches to hands, they're not real, understand

    E                 F#
and I am here tonight

CHORUS:
                      B                  E
And someday you'll know that nature is so

         C#m                      F#
the same rain that draws you near me

                        B                      E
falls on rivers and land, on forests and sand

          G#m                         F#
makes the beautiful world that you see

       E
in the morning

B/D# G#m F# B/F# F# B/F# B

E                     F#
For you know, once even I was a

[Verse]

   B                 F#/A#
...little child, and I was afraid

      A               E/G#
but a gentle someone always came

   G#m                      B/F#
to dry all my tears, trade sweet sleep for fears

       E
and to give a kiss goodnight


[Chorus]

F#         F#sus4  B                          E
Well now I am grown and these years have shown

              C#m                   F#
that rain's a part of how life goes

                           B                         E
But it's dark and it's late so I'll hold you and wait

           G#m                F#
'til your frightened eyes do close

                           B                Eadd2
And I hope that you'll know that nature is so

         C#m7                     F#sus4
the same rain that draws you near me

         F#              B                   E
falls on rivers and land, on forests and sand

          G#m                            F#
makes the beautiful world that you'll see

         E
in the morning

B/D#                        C#m
Everything's fine in the morning

    B                        G#m
The rain'll be gone in the morning,

    F#                          B
but I'll still be here in the morning
