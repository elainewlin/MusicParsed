[Intro]

C     Bm
Oh yeah
[Verse]

C
So scared of breaking it
      Bm              Em
But you won't let it bend
C
And I wrote two hundred letters
Bm            Em
I will ever send
C
Sometimes it cuts so much
Bm                Em
Deeper then they seem
C
You'd rather cover up
Bm                   Em
I'd rather let them be
      C
So let me be
           Bm
And I'll set you free
[Chorus]

Em     Am    D    G
I am in misery
        Em          Am
There ain't no body
         D      G
Who can comfort me (oh yeah)
Em    Am        D      G
Why won't you answer me?
      Em         Am     D      G
Your silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah)
Em               Am
Girl you really got me bad
D                  G
You really got me bad
Em                 Am
I'm gonna get you back
D              G
Gonna get you back
[Verse 2]

C
Your salty skin and how
      Bm              Em
It mixes in with mine
C
The way it feels to be
   Bm              Em
Completely intertwined
C
Not that I didn't care
   Bm              Em
It's that I didn't know
C
It's not what I didn't feel,
   Bm              Em
It's what I didn't show
C
So let me be
   Bm              Em
And I'll set you free
[Chorus]

Em  Am    D    G
I am in misery
        Em          Am
There ain't no body
         D      G
Who can comfort me (oh yeah)
Em    Am        D      G
Why won't you answer me?
      Em         Am     D      G
The silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah)
Em               Am
Girl you really got me bad
D                  G
You really got me bad
Em                 Am
I'm gonna get you back
D              G
Gonna get you back
[Verse 3]

C
Say your faith is shaken
Bm
You may be mistaken
Em
You keep me wide awake and
G
Waiting for the sun
C
I'm desperate and confused
Bm
So far away from you
G
I'm getting here
Bm
Don't care where I have to go
Em   Am     D           G
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Em   Am           D           G
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Em   Am     D           G
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Em   Am           D           G

Em     Am    D    G
I am in misery
        Em          Am
There ain't no other
         D      G
Who can comfort me
Em    Am        D      G
Why won't you answer me?
      Em         Am     D      G
Your silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah)
