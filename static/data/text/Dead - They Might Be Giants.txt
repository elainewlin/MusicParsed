[Verse]
A            D      E         A          D     E       A
I returned a bag of groceries accidently taken off the shelf
           D   E      A
Before the expiration date
A                D      E         A          D     E       A
I came back as a bag of groceries accidently taken off the shelf
           D            E    A      A7
Before the date stamped on myself
[Bridge]
D                       D/C♯       Bm                      A/C♯   D
 Did a large procession wave their torches as my head fell in the basket
                  E
And was everybody dancing on the casket
[Chorus]
A                  D                  Bm      D            E
 Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want
       A      D                Bm        G       A   D   E
Or I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
[Verse]
A            D       E       A          D
I will never say the word procrastinate again
     E     A                 D      E       A
I'll never see myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
A          D   E         A                     D       E       A
 I didn't apologize for when I was eight and I made my younger brother
        D     E        A       A7
Have to be my personal slave
[Bridge]
D                       D/C♯       Bm                      A/C♯   D
 Did a large procession wave their torches as my head fell in the basket
                  E

A                  D                  Bm      D            E
 Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want
       A      D                Bm        G       A   D   E
Or I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
[Chorus]
D    D     D/C♯   D/C♯ E  E    E7/D    E7/D
So I won't sit at home anymore and you won't
A/C♯   A/C♯    A/B    A/B D     D     D/C♯ D/C♯
See my head in the window and I won't be  around
E    E  E7/D     E7/D    A/C♯            D           E
Ever anymore and I'll be up there on the wall at the store
[Verse]
