[Verse 1]

C            Am
And when it rains,
                 F           C         Am
On this side of town it touches, everything.
              F            C
Just say it again and mean it.
                      F
We don't miss a thing, You made yourself a bed
                       C
At the bottom of the blackest hole
        F
And convinced yourself that
                         C                       G
It's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore


[Chorus]

    F        Am            C
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
F      G         Am
Oh I, I never saw it coming.
F        Am           C
Oh, oh, I need the ending.
    F             G
So why can't you stay
            Am        C
Just long enough to explain?


[Verse 2]

             Am
And when it rains,
                 F         C
Will you always find an escape?
               Am                  F             C 
Just running away from all of the ones who love you,
                F
From everything.  you made yourself a bed
                      C
At the bottom of the blackest hole
             F
And you'll sleep 'til May
                                     C                    G
And you'll say that you don't want to see the sun anymore


[Chorus]

    F        Am           C
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
F      G         Am
Oh I, I never saw it coming.
F       Am            C
Oh, oh, I need the ending.
    F             G
So why can't you stay
           Am        C
Just long enough to explain?


[Bridge]

Am   G     F
Take your time.
Am    G    F
Take my time.

Am                     G
Take these chances to turn it around.
F
Take these chances, we'll make it somehow
Am                          G
And take these chances to turn it around.
       F
Just turn it around.


[Chorus]

    F        Am           C
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
F      G         Am
Oh I, I never saw it coming.
    F        Am           C
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
F      G         Am
Oh I, I never saw it coming.
    F        Am           C
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
F      G         Am
Oh I, I never saw it coming.
F        Am         C
Oh, oh, I need the ending.
    F             G
So why can't you stay
           Am       C
Just long enough to explain?


[Outro]

Am                 G            F
You can take your time, take my time.
