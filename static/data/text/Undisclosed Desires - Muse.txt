[Verse]
C 
I know you've suffered
   Em
But I don't want you to hide
C
It's cold and loveless
     Em
I won't let you be denied

C
Soothing
  Em
I'll make you feel pure
 C
And trust me
Em
You can be sure


[Chorus]
Am         C             Em               G
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Am         C              Em                  G
I want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask
Am         C            Em               G
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Am         C           Em            G             C         
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart


[Verse]
You trick your lovers
         Em
That you're wicked and divine
C
You may be a sinner
      Em
But your innocence is mine
C
Please me
Em
Show me how it's done
C
Tease me
Em
You are the one


[Chorus]
Am         C             Em               G
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Am         C              Em                  G
I want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask
Am         C            Em               G
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Am         C           Em            G             C         
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart


[Verse]
C
Please me
Em
Show me how it's done
C
Trust me
Em
You are the one


[Chorus]
Am         C             Em               G
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Am         C              Em                  G
I want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask
Am         C            Em               G
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Am         C           Em            G             C         
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
