[Verse]
E♭
I know you've suffered
   Gm
But I don't want you to hide
E♭
It's cold and loveless
     Gm
I won't let you be denied
E♭
Soothing
  Gm
I'll make you feel pure
 E♭
And trust me
Gm
You can be sure
[Chorus]
Cm         E♭             Gm               B♭
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Cm         E♭              Gm                  B♭
I want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask
Cm         E♭            Gm               B♭

Cm         E♭           Gm            B♭             E♭
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
[Verse]
You trick your lovers
         Gm
That you're wicked and divine
E♭
You may be a sinner
      Gm
But your innocence is mine
E♭
Please me
Gm
Show me how it's done
E♭
Tease me
Gm
You are the one
[Chorus]
