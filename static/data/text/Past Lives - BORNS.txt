[Intro]

E
Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
B             G#                         A
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
             B 
I've got the strangest feeling
A           B
This isn't our first time around

E
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
B              G#                    
Some time the dreamers finally wake up
A             B
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
A             B
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming

E


[Verse 1]

E
All my past lives they got nothing on me
E
Golden eagle you're the one and only
A
Flying high through the cities and the sky

E
I take you way back, cover centuries
                                                A
Don't you remember, that you were meant to be my Queen of Hearts

Meant to be my love


[Pre-Chorus]

          C#m
Oooooooooooo
                   B
Through all of my lives
                     E                A
I never thought I'd wait so long for you
               C#m                    B
The timing is right, the stars are aligned


[Chorus]

   E
So save that heart for me
                        A
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
C#m
Swear to the moon, the stars, the sons, and the daughters
B                            A
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

E
Hey I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long


[Verse 2]

E
Passing seasons, empty bottles of wine
                                                   A
My ancient kingdom, came crashing down without you baby child

I'm lost without your love

E
Diamond sparrow, my moonlit majesty

You know I need you, come flying back to me

C#m                B
Through all of my lives
                     E                A
I never thought I'd wait so long for you
              C#m                    B
The timing is right, the stars are aligned


[Chorus]

E
So save that heart for me
                         A
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
C#m
Swear to the moon, the stars, the sons, and the daughters
B                            A
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

E
Save that heart for me
                      A
And girl I'll give you everything you’ll need

Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
