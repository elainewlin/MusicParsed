G                                     
Everybody told me Gem stuff's dangerous

Em                                C 
I guess I didn't believe it until now

                       Am     
Dad always seemed apprehensive

C                  Am          
And now he's really freaking out

          C 
What do I do?

                      D 
I don't want that for you

-Phone starts ringing-

G                                 
Everybody tells me life is precious

Em                                  C 
On the planet Earth, and that means you

                 Am      
And I have to protect you

C              Am          
What if somehow you get hurt

          C 
What do I do?

                      D 
I don't want that for you

-Phone starts ringing again-

G    B    Em    D    
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh...

C                 Em       
What am I going to tell you?

C                    Em                      C 
You're better off not knowing the trouble I'm in,

C                  Em   
I don't want you to worry

C                   Em   
About what I've just seen,

                 D   C  
About where I've just been

                  Bm               
You don't have to be a part of this

Em                          C
I don't think I want you to be

               Am  
You don't need this

               D
You don't need me

-Phone starts ringing for the third time-

G    B    Em    D         
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh... (x2)
