[Pre-Chorus]

 Am                               F  
I never really knew that she could dance like this
G               Em
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
F                G           Am                                     
   Como se llama (si), bonita (si), mi casa (si, Shakira Shakira), su casa
Shakira, Shakira..
Am                   F
   Oh baby when you talk like that
G           Em
You make a woman go mad
F             G        
   So be wise     and keep on
Am 
 Reading the signs of my body...

[Chorus]
 
Am     F
And I'm on tonight
             G
You know my hips don't lie
         Em
And I'm starting to feel it's right
F              G
All the attraction, the tension
Am
Don't you see baby, this is perfection


[Verse 2]

Am
Hey Girl, I can see your body moving 
Am
And it's driving me crazy 
Am
And I didn't have the slightest idea 
Am
Until I saw you dancing 

Am
And when you walk up on the dance floor 
Am
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move 
Am
your body, girl 
Am
And everything so unexpected - the way 
Am
you right and left it 
Am
So you can keep on taking it 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Am     F
And I'm on tonight
             G
You know my hips don't lie
         Em
And I'm starting to feel it's right
F              G
Come on let's go - real slow
Am
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto
Am     F
And I'm on tonight
             G
You know my hips don't lie
         Em
And I'm starting to feel it's right
F              G
All the attraction, the tension
Am
Don't you see baby, this is perfection


[Verse 3]

Am
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Am 
Half animal, half man 
Am
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing 
Am
But you seem to have a plan 
Am
My will and self restraint 
Am
Have come to fail now, fail now 
Am
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so 
Am
you know 
Am
That's a bit too hard to explain 

Am              G
Baila en la calle de noche 
                Am
Baila en la calle de dia 
                G
Baila en la calle de noche 
                Am
Baila en la calle de dia 


[Pre-Chorus]


[Bridge]

Am
Se√±orita, feel the conga, let me see you 
move like you come from Colombia 
Am
Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it! 
Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi 

Am
Yeah 
She's so sexy every man's fantasy 
Am
a refugee like me back with the Fugees 
from a 3rd world country 
Am
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for 
Humpty Humpty 
Am
I need a whole club dizzy 
Why the CIA wanna watch us? 
Am
Colombians and Haitians 
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction 
Am
No more we do snatch ropes 
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our 
own boats 


[Chorus]

Am     F
And I'm on tonight
             G
You know my hips don't lie
         Em
And I'm starting to feel it's right
F              G
Come on let's go - real slow
Am
Oh baby this is perfecto
Am     F
And I'm on tonight
             G
You know my hips don't lie
         Em
And I'm starting to feel it's right
F              G
All the attraction, the tension
Am
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
