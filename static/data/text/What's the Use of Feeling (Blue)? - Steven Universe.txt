[Verse 1]
Am                   Dm  E7
Why would you want to be here?
     Am          Dm7 G7sus4 G7
What do you ever see here?
     Cmaj7                                Ebdim7
That doesn't make you feel worse than you do?
    Eaug7 E7  Am                Ebdim7   Eaug7 E7
And tell  me, what’s the use of feeling, Blue?

[Verse 2]
Am                       Dm7 E7
Why would you want to employ her
Am                Dm7   G7sus4 G7
Subjects that destroyed her?
Cmaj7                 Ebdim7
Why keep up her silly zoo?
   Eaug7 E7  Am                Ebdim7 E7    Am
Oh tell  me, what’s the use of fee -  ling, Blue?

[Bridge]
   Dm7        G7             Cmaj7
An army has a use, they can go and fight a war
E7                            Am
A Sapphire has a use, she can tell you what it’s for
   E7                 Am          Ebdim7
An Agate terrifies, a Lapis terraforms
              Ebdim7
Where’s their diamond when they need her, Blue?
                   Ebdim7  E7
You’ve got to be a leader, Blue

[Chorus]
Cmaj7                    Dm7  G7sus4 G7
Yes, of course, we still love her
          Cmaj7  C6       Dm7 G7sus4 G7
And we’re always thinking of  her
    Cmaj7                      Ebdim7 Eaug7 E7
But now there’s nothing we can do, so tell  me
Am                Ebdim7 E7    Am                Ebdim7 E7
What’s the use of fee -  ling? What’s the use of fee -  ling?
Am                Ebdim7 E7    Am            
What’s the use of fee -  ling, Blue?

[Middle]
G7                          Cmaj7 
Oh, how can you stand to be here with it all? 
Fmaj7
Drowning in all this regret
Fmaj7                   E  E7
Wouldn’t you rather forget her?
G7                                 Cmaj7
Won’t it be grand to get rid of it all?
Fmaj7
Let’s make a plan of attack
Fmaj7                     G7
Start looking forward and stop looking back, oh

[Chorus]
Cmaj7                    Dm7  G7sus4 G7
Yes, of course, we still love her
          Cmaj7  C6       Dm7 G7sus4 G7
And we’re always thinking of  her
Cmaj7                      Fmaj7    E7
Don’t you know I miss her, too? But tell me
Cmaj7             Ebdim7 E7    Cmaj7             Ebdim7 E7
What’s the use of fee -  ling? What’s the use of fee -  ling?
Cmaj7             Ebdim7 E7             
What’s the use of fee -  ling?
