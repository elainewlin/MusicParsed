[Verse 1]
A
White lips, pale face
               E/G♯ F♯m
Breathing in snowflakes
              D    A
Burnt lungs, sour taste
A
Light's gone, day's end
              E/G♯ F♯m
Struggling to pay rent
                D    A
Long nights, strange men
[Pre-Chorus]
      Bm
And they say
                   D
She's in the Class A Team
               A
Stuck in her daydream
                    E/G♯
Been this way since 18
                Bm
But lately her face seems
                 D
Slowly sinking, wasting
                A
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
     E/G♯
The worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 1]
            F♯m            D
Cos we're just under the upperhand
A
And go mad for a couple of grams
F♯m                    D      A
And she don't want to go outside tonight
          F♯m                    D
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
A
Or sells love to another man
F♯m        D       A
It's too cold outside
    E         F♯m  D  A
For angels to fly
           F♯m  D  A
Angels to fly
[Verse 2]
A
Ripped gloves, raincoat
                    E/G♯  F♯m
Tried to swim and stay afloat
            D   A
Dry house, wet clothes
A
Loose change, bank notes
             E/G♯ F♯m
Weary-eyed, dry throat
           D    A
Call girl, no phone
[Pre-Chorus]
      Bm
And they say
                   D
She's in the Class A Team
              A
Stuck in her daydream
                    E/G♯
Been this way since 18
               Bm
But lately her face seems
                 D
Slowly sinking, wasting
                A
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
     E/G♯
The worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 1]
           F♯m                  D
Cos we're just under the upperhand
A
And go mad for a couple of grams
F♯m                    D      A
And she don't want to go outside tonight
         F♯m                     D
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
A
Or sells love to another man
F♯m        D       A
It's too cold outside
    E         Bm
For angels to fly
[Bridge]
              D
An angel will die
             F♯m
Covered in white
Closed eye
     A
And hoping for a better life
Bm                         D
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
[Solo]
F♯m D A
 F♯m D A
[Pre-Chorus]
      Bm
And they say
                   D
She's in the Class A Team
              A
Stuck in her daydream
                    E/G♯
Been this way since 18
               Bm
But lately her face seems
                 D
Slowly sinking, wasting
                A
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
     E/G♯
The worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 2]
          F♯m             D
Cos we're all under the upperhand
A
And go mad for a couple of grams
F♯m                   D     A
And we don't want to go outside tonight
          F♯m                 D
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
A
Or sell love to another man
F♯m        D       A
It's too cold outside
    E          F♯m D A
For angels to fly
            F♯m D A
Angels to fly
   F♯m D  A
To fly, fly
           F♯m      D       A
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
   E       A
Angels to die
