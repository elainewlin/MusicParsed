[Verse]
G       D      Am             C
Did you see me standing there in the corner?
  G    D       Am           C
I was alone, I always am at these big parties.
G        D    Am       C
Watching you; watching everybody.
G             D
Wishing I was more outgoing;
Am            C
Wishing I was dressed up pretty.

[Verse]
G             D     Am           C
But there you were, standing in your own corner.
     G         D     Am             C
Your eyes were wide, tired, fading, just like mine.
G        D      Am                  C
We could be the best of friends I'm sure of it.
G           D      Am                 C
But I'm too shy to cross this crowded room besides.

Help me leave this corner of the room.

I'm reaching out to you.
     G        Am             C
'Cuz I've got things I could talk to you about.
    Am7         G   D      Am7
And we could be wallflower friends
