        Am                 
She was trapped in a mirror

       E7                 
And it couldn't be clearer

              F               
She wanted to leave this place

           E7                
And get herself back in space

    Am                          C       
And dad you might think she's a criminal

        Dm                          F      
But her friendship comes through subliminal

      C       E7                Am            F  
Lapis Lazuli, you fled into the bottom of the sea

      C       E7                   Am                      Fm
Lapis Lazuli, you were so mad, but then you came around to me
