[Verse 1]

        Am
I'm holding on your rope,
        F               C       G
Got me ten feet off the ground
        Am                         F                 C         G
And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
       Am
You tell me that you need me
F                       C          G
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Am
You tell me that you're sorry
F                       C           G
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...


[Chorus]

          Am                  F       C           G
that it's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Am                 F        C         G
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

Am F C G


[Verse 2]

Am                              F
I'd take another chance, take a fall
                C       G
Take a shot for you
      Am                            F
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
                 C           G
But it's nothing new - yeah yeah

  Am                      F
I loved you with the fire red-
                C               G
Now it's turning blue, and you say...
Am                      F                      C
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
    G
But I'm afraid...

          Am                  F       C           G
that it's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Am                  F       C          G
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 
   Am  F     C       G
whoaa ohhh...

[Bridge]

Am F C G
Am F C G
          Am                  F       C          G
that it's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Am                 F        C         G
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Am                 F        C     G
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-
            Am                  F       C     G
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-
    Am                           F                   C      
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet... off the ground...
