[Chorus]
                       F                       C
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                        Am
Only hate the road when you're missin  home
               F                         C
Only know you love her when you've let her go
G
  And you let her go


[Instrumental]
Am   F   G   Em
Am   F   G


[Verse 1]
Am                            F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        G                            Em
Hoping one day you will make a dream last
               Am               F          G
The dreams come slow and they go so fast
    Am                          F
You see her when you close your eyes
      G                           Em
Maybe one day you will understand why
               Am           F         G
Everything you touch surely dies


[Chorus]
                      F                       C
But you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                        Am
Only hate the road when you're missin  home
               F                         C       G
Only know you love her when you've let her go


[Verse 2]
Am                            F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
         G                     Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
           Am                 F       G
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      F
Well you see her when you fall asleep
                G                  Em
But to never to touch and never to keep
                          Am
Because you loved her too much
                 F          G
And you dive too deep


[Chorus]
                       F                       C
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                         Am
Only hate the road when you're missin'  home
               F                         C
Only know you love her when you've let her go


[Bridge]
                Am
And you let her go
      F     G
Ooooo ooooo oooooo
                Am
And you let her go
        F     G
Ooooooo ooooo ooooo
                Am         F    G   Em
And you let her go

[Interlude]
Am    F    G

[Chorus]
                          F                       C
Because you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                         Am
Only hate the road when you're missin'  home
               F                         C
Only know you love her when you've let her go


[Chorus]
                          F                     C
Because you only need the light when it burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                        Am
Only hate the road when you're missin  home
               F                         C
Only know you love her when you've let her go
G                             Am
  And you let her go
