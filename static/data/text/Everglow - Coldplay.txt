[Verse 1]
   C#m         A
Oh they say people come
   E          G#m7
say people go
        C#m      A           E     B
this particular diamond was extra special
       C#m      A
And though you might be gone
        E             G#m7
And the world may not know
        C#m        A      Bsus4 B6
Still I see you celestial

[Instrumental]
C#m A E B
C#m A E B

       C#m       A
Like a lion you ran
E           G#m7
A goddess you rolled
        C#m        A
Like an eagle you circled
   E          B
In perfect purple
       C#m               A
So how come things move on?
    E               G#m7
How come cars don't slow?
        C#m             A          Bsus4 B6
When it feels like the end of my world
       C#m           A              Bsus4 B6
When I should but I can't let you go

[Chorus 1]
             C#m  A E  G#m7
But when I'm cold, cold
         C#m  A E  B
When I'm cold, cold
          C#m             A
There's a light that you give me
         E     G#m7
When I'm in shadow
       C#m         A        Bsus4 B6
There's a feeling within me, everglow

[Instrumental]
C#m A E B
C#m A E B

[Verse 2]
     C#m          A
Like brothers in blood
    E           G#m7
sisters who ride
        C#m            A
And we swore on that night
        E               B
We'd be friends â€˜til we die
         C#m          A
But the changing of winds
        E          G#m7
And the way waters flow
        C#m           A          Bsus4 B6
Life is short as the falling of snow
      C#m           A           Bsus4 B6     
And now I'm going to miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
             C#m  A E  G#m7
But when I'm cold, cold
         C#m  A   E   B
In water rolled, salt
      C#m               A
And I know that you're with me
        E            G#m7               C#m          A      Bsus4 B6 
And the way you will show, when you're with me wherever I go
        C#m           A                 Bsus4 B6 
But you give me this feeling, this everglow

[Bridge]
C#m A E G#m7
C#m A E B
C#m A E G#m7

                 C#m              A            Bsus4 B6 
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
        C#m            A                 Bsus4 B6 
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

[Outro]
C#m A E G#m7
C#m A E B

      C#m           A              E         G#m7
So if you love someone, you should let them know
        C#m             A              Bsus4 B6 C#m
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
