[Verse]

                Em   G     D
I don't like my mind right now
            G                 D    C
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
                  Em   G      D
Wish that I could slow things down
            G                 D    C
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic


[Prechorus]

      Em    G  D
And I drive myself crazy
         G             D    C
Thinking everything's about me
       Em    G  D
Yeah I drive myself crazy
          G              D    C
Cause I can't escape the gravity


[Chorus]

            Em  G D
I'm holding on
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
        Em  G D
Holding on
G       D           C
So much more than I can carry
       Em       G      D
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
     G     D     C
If I just let go, I'd be set free
        Em  G D
Holding on
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
 

[Verse]
                 Em  G  D
You say that I'm paranoid
               G         D       C
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
                Em   G    D
It's not like I make the choice
   G           D       C
To let my mind stay so fucking messy


[Prechorus]

  Em     G         D
I know I'm not the center of the universe
    G     D           C
But you keep spinning round me just the same
  Em     G         D
I know I'm not the center of the universe
    G     D           C
But you keep spinning round me just the same


[Chorus]

            Em  G  D
I'm holding on
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
        Em  G D
Holding on
G       D           C
So much more than I can carry
       Em       G      D
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
     G     D     C
If I just let go, I'd be set free
        Em  G  D
Holding on
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy


[Bridge]

  Em     G         D
I know I'm not the center of the universe
    G     D           C
But you keep spinning round me just the same
  Em     G         D
I know I'm not the center of the universe
    G     D           C
But you keep spinning round me just the same
      Em    G  D
And I drive myself crazy
         G             D    C
Thinking everything's about me
 

[Chorus]

            Em  G  D
I'm holding on
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
        Em  G  D
Holding on
G       D           C
So much more than I can carry
       Em       G      D
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
     G     D     C
If I just let go, I'd be set free
        Em  G  D
Holding on
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
Em  G  D
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
Em  G  D
G   D       C
Why is everything so heavy
