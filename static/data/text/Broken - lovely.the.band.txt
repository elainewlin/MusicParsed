[Chorus]
   Bm
I like that you’re broken
G
broken like me
D                        A
Maybe that makes me a fool
   Bm
I like that you’re lonely
G
lonely like me
D                        A
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 1]
          Em                Bm
I met you late night, at a party
                 D                A
Some trust fund baby’s Brooklyn loft
        Em                         Bm
By the bathroom, you said let’s talk,
          D                  A
But my confidence is wearing off

[Pre-chorus]
                Em
These aren’t my people
                Bm
These aren’t my friends
               D                        A
She grabbed my face and that’s when she said

[Chorus]
   Bm
I like that you’re broken
G
broken like me
D                        A
Maybe that makes me a fool
   Bm
I like that you’re lonely
G
lonely like me
D                        A
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 2]
                   Em                Bm
There’s something tragic, but almost pure
               D                    A
Think I could love you, but I’m not sure
                   Em                          Bm
There’s something wholesome, there’s something sweet
                D                    A
Tucked in your eyes that I’d love to meet

[Pre-chorus]
                Em
These aren’t my people
                Bm
These aren’t my friends
               D                        A
She grabbed my face and that’s when she said

[Chorus]

I could be lonely with you

[Bridge]
              F#m       Bm
Life is not a love song that we like
                 Em              A
We’re all broken pieces floating by
              F#m       Bm
Life is not a love song we can try
                  Em              A
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

[Chorus]
   Bm
I like that you’re broken
G
broken like me
D                        A
Maybe that makes me a fool
   Bm
I like that you’re lonely
G
lonely like me
D                        A
I could be lonely with you

[Chorus]
   Bm
I like that you’re broken
G
broken like me
D                        A
Maybe that makes me a fool

I like that you’re lonely
G
lonely like me
D                        A
I could be lonely with you
