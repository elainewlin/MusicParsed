[Verse]

    G#m      E
You push me
                 B           F#
I don’t have the strength to
              G#m        E
Resist or control you
        B
Take me down
         F#
Take me down
    G#m      E
You hurt me
           B           F#
But do I deserve this?
               G#m        E
You make me so nervous
        B
Calm me down
F#
Calm me down


[Chorus]

B
Wake you up
B
In the middle of the night to say
                  G#m     E
I will never walk away again
                B          F#
I’m never gonna leave this bed


[Verse]

   G#m        E
So come here
                B          F#
And never leave this place
              G#m        E
Perfection of your face
           B
Slows me down
F#
Slows me down
   G#m       E
So fall down
              B         F#
I need you to trust me
                G#m        E
Go easy, don’t rush me
        B
Help me out
               F#
Why don’t you help me out ?


[Chorus]

B
Wake you up
B
In the middle of the night to say
                  G#m     E
I will never walk away again
                B          F#
I’m never gonna leave this bed
B
You say "Go, it isn’t workin’ "
   F#
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
    G#m       E
So I stay instead
                B          F#
I’m never gonna leave this bed


[Verse]

G#m
Take it, take it all
E
Take all that I have
    B                        F#
I’ll give it all away just to get you back
G#m
Fake it, fake it all
E
Take what I can get
B
Knockin’ so loud
          F#
Can’t you hear me yell?
B                       F#
I try to stay away, but you can’t forget


[Chorus]

B
Wake you up
                     B/A#
In the middle of the night to say
                  G#m    E
I will never walk away again
                B          F#
I’m never gonna leave this bed
B  
You say "Go, it isn’t workin’ "
F#
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
     G#m     E
So I stay instead
                B          F#
I’m never gonna leave this bed
