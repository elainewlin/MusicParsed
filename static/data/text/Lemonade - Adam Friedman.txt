G  Em  C  D

[Verse 1]
G                Em      C                D
  I went down to Georgia, looking for the one
G                   Em            C                D
  I even checked in New York City, I didn't have no luck
G                 EM                  C                D
  So I'm going to S.F., where all you nerdy boys are hiding
        G            D          Em    D
I got my old school Chevy, and my labrador
       C           D           G
Headed down to the liquor store
N.C.
Begging

[Chorus]
G      Em         C     D
  California, you're my last hope
G         Em     C      D
  Give me someone I can take home
   G              Em             C           D
And, I don't know how much longer that I can wait
           G    D Em      D         C          D        G
So make him 6'2", eyes bright blue and sweet like lemonade
G    D  Em  D  C  D   G
Ooooooh, ooooooh, ohhhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
G            Em
  I got that good cologne
C                D
  And I got that charm
 G                    Em
  I just need a pretty Cali girl
C                 D
  To put under my arm
G                     Em
  And I know what you need darlin'
C               D
  But I need it too
           G         D       Em       D
  A little love and affection all night long
         C     D         G
  I got a whole bunch for you
N.C.
I'm going out to

[Chorus]
G      Em    C          D
  California, you're my last hope
G         Em     C      D
  Give me someone I can take home
G                 Em                   C    D
And, I don't know how much longer that I can wait
           G   D Em        D        C          D         G
So make him 6'2", eyes bright blue and sweet like lemonade

[Bridge]
C                                  D
  Now that I got you wrapped up in my arms
C                            D
  There ain't nobody else to hold (no)
C                                  D
  Now that I got you wrapped up in my arms
C                               D
  There ain't no other place to go  oh ohh
N.C.
  But

[Chorus]
G      Em    C          D
  California, you're my last hope
G         Em     C      D
  Give me someone I can take home
G                 Em                   C    D
And, I don't know how much longer that I can wait
           G    D Em      D         C          D        G
So make him 6'2", eyes bright blue and sweet like lemonade
G      Em    C          D
  California, you're my last hope
G         Em     C      D
  Give me someone I can take home
G                 Em                   C    D
And, I don't know how much longer that I can wait
           G   D Em        D        C          D         G
So make him 6'2", eyes bright blue and sweet like lemonade
