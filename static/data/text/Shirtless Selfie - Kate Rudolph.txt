Verse:
G        D           Em         C
Josh and Chelsea are climbing a mountain
G          D              Em   C
Off in the wilderness of Acadia
G           D     Em                   C
Chelsea and Josh, on their way up that mountain
G                       D                Em         C
And you know what's gon happen when they get to the top

G          D         Em        C
It's a tradition, a sacred tradition
G            D        Em            C
Thomas will tell you that I made it up
G              D      Em               C
But it's a tradition, as old as the mountain
G      D            Em         C
Every time that you get to the to-o-o-op

Chorus:
Em                G
Shirtless seflie, everybody
Em                      G
Take your shirt off and take a selfie
C                 D                  G    C   G
It doesn't really matter how cold it gets
Em                G
Shirtless selfie, everybody
Em                      G
Take your shirt off and join our selfie
C                 D                  G

Verse:
G                  D        Em        C
If you're on Mount Whitney, or Kilimanjaro
G           D        Em           C
Or maybe Denali, or just Mt Davidson
G                D       Em                  C
It might not be prudent, you'll probbly get frostbite
G                D                   Em       C
But giving into peer pressure can be so much fun
