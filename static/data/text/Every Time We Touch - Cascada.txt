CAPO 1

[Verse]

Em                G              D             C
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
Em                G          D
I still feel your touch in my dreams
C            G             D             Em
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
C           G           D
Without you It's hard to survive.


[Chorus]

                    C      D          Em
Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling 
                 C      D             Em
and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
                  C          G
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
  D          Em
I want this to last
G              D
Need you by my side
                   C       D       Em
Cause everytime we touch I feel the static 
                 C      D             Em
and everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
                 C           G
Can't you hear my heart beat so
  D            Em
I can't let you go
G              D
Want you in my life


[Verse]

Em               G            D           C
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
Em             G            D
They wipe away tears that I cry
C                G               D                 Em
The good and the bad times we've been through them all
C           G           D
You make me rise when I fall


[Chorus]

                    C      D          Em
Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling 
                 C      D             Em
and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
                  C          G
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
  D          Em
I want this to last
G              D
Need you by my side
                   C       D       Em
Cause everytime we touch I feel the static 
                 C      D             Em
and everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
                 C           G
Can't you hear my heart beat so
  D            Em
I can't let you go
G              D
Want you in my life
                    C      D          Em
