[Verse]

   C
The way you can't cut a rug
G                              Am
Watching you's the only drug I need
         
You're so gangster I'm so thug
           F                            C
You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see
                          G
I can be myself now final-ly
                                Am
In fact there's nothing I can't be
                            F       G
I want the world to see you be with   me


[Chorus]

F               G                 C      G      F
Hey soul sister ain't that Mister Mister on the radio stereo

The way you move aint fair you know
F               G               C      G      F               G
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do to-night
