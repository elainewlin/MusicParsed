[Verse]
      D             Em7
We're far apart, in every way
    G                    A
But you're the best part of my day
    D          Em7
And sure as I, breathe the air
G                 A
I know we are the perfect pair

[Chorus]
     Em                G          D      A
On a prickly path that goes on for miles
         Em               G        D    A
But it's worth it just to see you smile

    D            Em7
And I cannot, be pulled apart
G                 A
From the hold you have on my heart
    D           Em7                 G
And even if the world tells us it's wrong
             A
You're in my head like a catchy song~

[Verse]
    D                   Em7
The seasons change, and leaves may fall
    G                A
But I'll be with you through it all
    D              Em7              G    A
And rain or shine, you'll always be mine

[Chorus]
     Em                G          D      A
On a prickly path that goes on for miles
           Em           G                  D     A
You're the only one who makes them all worth while

[Outro]
    D              Em7
And you should not blame me, too
   G                       A
If I can't help fallin' in love with you~
