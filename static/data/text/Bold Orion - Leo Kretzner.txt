Verse 1:
         Am
When the days are gettin' shorter
        G
and the nights are growin' long,
        F                 G
and the north wind puts a tear in-
        Am
to your eye

          Am
If you're out about round midnight
        G
and you look off to the east,
          F             G
there you may see bold Orion
       Am
on the rise

        C
You may know him by his stance or
       Am
by the starry shield he holds
      C
as he rises silent in a
      Am
clear cold sky

           G
Young Jack Frost and Old Man Winter,
          Am
they both beckon to the call
         G             F
of their master, bold Orion
       Am
on the rise

Chorus:
      F            Am
Bold Orion, mighty hunter
       G               Am
rising in a clear cold sky
        F             Am
See the summer fall before him;
      G      F          Am
bold Orion's ... on the rise.

Verse 2:
    Am
For seven starry ages
       G
he has ruled the winter skies,
         F             G
with the fires of lost eons
       Am
in his eyes

       Am
He has seen the rise and fall of
          G
kings and continents and all,
       F             G
rising silent, bold Orion
       Am
on the rise

          C
When he ascends no hesitation,
        Am
when he moves no turnin' round;
       C
like a soul been called to glory,
        Am
earthly born but heav'nly bound

        G
Now the bird is on the wing,
         Am
and it's southward that she flies
         G           F
hastened on by bold Orion
       Am
on the rise

Chorus:
      F            Am
Bold Orion, mighty hunter
       G               Am
rising in a clear cold sky
        F             Am
See the summer fall before him;
      G      F          Am
bold Orion's ... on the rise.

Verse 3:
       Am
Summer comes on all too slowly
       G
and it passes far too fast
        F                 G
and you wonder - is there nothin'
         Am
that can last?

       Am
Here today and gone tomorrow
       G
as the green leaves turn to red,
       F               G
as the present quickly turns in-
        Am
-to the past

        C
Cut the wood and stack it high now,
          Am
stoke the fires in your home.
        C
Burnin' nightly send the smoke up
       Am
to the sky

         G
Keep the winter at your door, and
         Am
keep the summer in your heart.
        G              F
Drink a toast to bold Orion
       Am
on the rise.

Chorus:
      F            Am
Bold Orion, mighty hunter
       G               Am
rising in a clear cold sky
        F             Am
See the summer fall before him;
      G      F          Am
bold Orion's ... on the rise.

      F            Am
Bold Orion, mighty hunter
       G               Am
rising in a clear cold sky
        F             Am
See the summer fall before him;
      G      F          Am
bold Orion's ... on the rise.

      G      F          Am
Bold Orion's ... on the rise.
