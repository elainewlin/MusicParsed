[Intro]

G  D  C       G  D  C  
doo.. doo.. doo..

[Verse 1]
                   G
I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling
      D                           C
She's living she's golden and she lives for me
                           G
She says she lives for me Ovation
    D
her own motivation
C                                     G
She comes around and she goes down on me
                D                    C
And I make her smile like a drug for you  

Do ever what you want to do
            G
Coming over you
         D
Keep on smiling what we go through
C
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
G                D                          C
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
                                     G
Chop another link like a coda with a curse
                     D                     C
And I come on like a freak show takes the stage 

We give them the games we play she said


[Chorus 1]

G      D         C
I want something else
                  G
To get me through this
D                    C
Semi-charmed kind of life baby baby
G      D         C
I want something else
I'm not listening 
         G  D    C
when you say Goodbye


[Post-chorus]

G  D  C       G  D  C  
doo.. doo.. doo..


[Verse 2]
               G
The sky it was gold it was rose
      D                            C
I was taking sips of it through my nose

And I wish I could get back there
           G
Some place back there
               D
Smiling in the pictures you would take
C
Doing crystal myth will lift

you up until you break
          G                D
It won't stop I won't come down
                    C
I keep stock with a tick-tock 

rhythm and a bump for the drop
           G
And then I bumped up
           D
I took the hit that I was given
       C
Then I bumped again

And then I bumped again and said


[Refrain]

D              C
How do I get back there to
    D
The place where I 
       C
dell asleep inside you?
D              C
How do I get myself back to
    D
The place where you said


[Chorus 1]

G      D         C
I want something else
                  G
To get me through this
D                    C
Semi-charmed kind of life baby baby
G      D         C
I want something else

I'm not listening 
         G  D    C
when you say Goodbye


[Verse 3]

G                  D
I believe in the sand 
           C
beneath my toes

The beach gives a feeling
          G
An earthy feeling 
    D
I believe in the 
           C
faith that grows

And the four right 
           G          D
chords can make me cry
C
When I'm with you I 
                  G
feel like I could die

And that would be 
D        C
all right All right


[Bridge]

             D
and when the plane came in
    C                    D
She said she was crashing
              C
The velvet it rips in 
            D
the city we tripped
               C
On the urge to feel alive
    G
But now I'm struggling to survive
      D
Those days you were wearing
     C
That velvet dress
D
You're the priestess
  C
I must confess
      D
Those little red panties
     C
They pass the test
      G
Slide up around the belly

Face down on the matress
D  C        D      C
One And you hold me
          D     C
and we're broken 
           G
Still it's all that I

wanna do just a little now 


[Verse 4]

G           D
Feel myself head 
            C
made of the ground 

I'm scared I'm not coming 
G   D   C
down No no And I won't 
        G      D
run for my life 
C
She's got her jaws now
                  G
locked down in a smile 
               D
But nothing is all 
     C
right all right 


[Chorus 2]

G     D          C
I want something else
          G       D     C
To get me through this life baby
G     D          C
I want something else

I'm not listening 
G        D       C  G/B Am
when you say Goodbye
    C  G/B Am
goodbye...
    C  G/B Am
goodbye...
    G  D C G D C
goodbye...


[Post-chorus]

G  D  C       G  D  C  
doo.. doo.. doo..


[Outro]

               G
The sky it was gold it was rose
      D                            C
I was taking sips of it through my nose

And I wish I could get back there
           G
Some place back there
       D                  C
in the place you used to start
G  D  C    G  D  C   
doo.. doo.. doo
