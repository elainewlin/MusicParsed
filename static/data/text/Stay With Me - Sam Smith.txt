Intro x2:

Am  F  C
Verse:

Am                       F             C
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
Am               F                  C
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
Am                 F          C
These nights never seem to go to plan
Am                  F                   C
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Chorus:

         Am    F    C
Won't you stay with me?
           Am    F C
Cause you're all I need
          Am         F        C
This ain't love it's clear to see
    G        Am   F    C
But darling, stay with me
Verse:

Am       F   C
Why am I so emotional?
Am                 F               C
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Am              F            C
And deep down I know this never works
Am                   F            C
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Chorus x3:

         Am    F    C
Won't you stay with me?
           Am    F C
Cause you're all I need
          Am         F        C
This ain't love it's clear to see
    G        Am   F    C
But darling, stay with me
