CAPO 1
[Verse 1]

Em           Cmaj7                  G
What would I do without your smart mouth
           D                      Em
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
          C            G               D          Em
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
             Cmaj7                 G
What's going on in that beautiful mind
                D             Em
I'm on your magical mystery ride
        Cadd9             G                 
And I'm so   dizzy, don't know what hit me, 
    D         Amadd9
but I'll be alright


[Pre-Chorus]

   Am             G
My head's under water
    D              Amadd9
But I'm breathing fine
                 G              D
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind


[Chorus]

       G
Cause all of me
       Emadd9
Loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
           C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Emadd9
I'll give my all to you
          Am/C
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   Dadd9
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    Dadd9
And you give me all, all of you, oh


[Verse 2]

Em       C                       G
How many times do I have to tell you
                 D                       Em
Even when you're crying youâ€™re beautiful too
              C           G      
The world is beating you down, 
    D                  Em
I'm around through every mood
             C                 G
You're my downfall, you're my muse
             D                        Em
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
                C             G        D            Am
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you


[Pre-Chorus]

   Am             G
My head's under water
    D              Amadd9
But I'm breathing fine
                 G              D
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind


[Chorus]

       G
Cause all of me
       Emadd9
Loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
           C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Emadd9
I'll give my all to you
          Am/C
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   Dadd9
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    Dadd9
And you give me all, all of you, oh


[Pre-Chorus Change]

Am         G
Cards on the table
       D             Amadd9
We're both showing hearts
Am       G                D
Risking it all, though it's hard


[Chorus]

       G
Cause all of me
       Emadd9
Loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
           C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Emadd9
I'll give my all to you
          Am/C
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   Dadd9
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    Dadd9
And you give me all, all of you, oh


[Outro]

                  Em   C      G   D
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you, oh
