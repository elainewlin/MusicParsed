[Intro x2]

Am  F
Ahhh
  G
Hey
C    G
Ahhh-Ahhh    


[Verse 1]

   Am
He knows
      F
Dirty secrets that I keep
        G
Does he know it’s killing me?
   C         G
He knows, he knows
            Am
D-d-does he know?
          F
Another’s hands have touched my skin
         G
I won’t tell him where I’ve been
C           G
He knows, he knows, he knows


[Pre-chorus]

F                G
It’s tearing me apart,
               Am
She’s slipping away [I’m slipping away]
Am                                  
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
F                   G
The pictures on her phone
                 Am
She’s not coming home [I’m not coming home]
                  E
Coming home, coming home


[Chorus]

Am
I know what you did last summer, [Ah-ah]
F
Just lied to me, there’s no other [Hey-ey]
G
I know what you did last summer,  
C      G
Tell me where you’ve been?
Am
I know what you did last summer, [Ah-ah]
F
Look me in the eyes my lover [Hey-ey]
G
I know what you did last summer,
C      G
Tell me where you’ve been?


[Post-Chorus]

Am                                F
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know [Ah-ah] [Hey-ey]
G                                 C              G
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know [Ah-ah] [Ah-ah]
Am                             F
I didn’t mean it, no, I didn’t mean it, mean it, no [Ah-ah] [Hey-ey]
G                         C                  G
Can’t seem to let you go, can’t seem to hold you close [Ah-ah] [Ah-ah]
Am
I know


[Verse 2]

Am       F
When she looks me in the eyes
G 
They don’t seem as bright, 
   C        G          Am
No more, no more, I know
         F
That she loved me at one time
        G
Would I promise her that night 
         C                 G
Cross my heart and hope to die


[Pre-Chorus]

F               G
It’s tearing me apart
               Am
She’s slipping away [I’m slipping away]
Am                                                F
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
                    G
The pictures on her phone [Pictures on my phone]
                 Am
She’s not coming home [I’m not coming home]
E
Oh, na na na yeah


[Chorus]

Am
I know what you did last summer, [Ah-ah]
F
Just lied to me, there’s no other [Hey-ey]
