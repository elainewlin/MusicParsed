Gm 
Wake up
Gm                            Gsus2
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Gsus2                            Gm
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup
Gm                                Gsus2
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Gsus2                       Gm
Here you go, create another fable
You wanted to!
Gm                            Gsus2
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to!
Gsus2                            Gm
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup
You wanted to!
Gm                                Gsus2
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to!

Fadd9   F
I       cry
     Eb
When angels deserve to
Gm
DIE!

When angels deserve to die...

Bb5      C5     Gm
Why have you forsaken me?
Fadd9            F
In your eyes, forsaken me?

In your thoughts, forsaken me?

In your heart, forsaken me?

In      my

Self-righteous suicide
Fadd9   F
I       cry
