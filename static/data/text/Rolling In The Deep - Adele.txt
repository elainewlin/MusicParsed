[Verse]

Am             Em                 
There's a fire starting in my heart,
G                               Em                     G
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Am             Em
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
G                                 Em                G
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship bare.

Am               Em
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
G                       Em                   G
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
Am             Em
There's a fire starting in my heart
G                               Em                      G
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark


[Pre-Chorus]

F                       G 
The scars of your love, remind me of us
Em                      F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
F                       G
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
Em              E7
I can't help feeling...


[Chorus]

Am                       G
We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
F                                                   G
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Am                                                             G
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
F                                                       G
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


[Verse]

Am             Em
Baby I have no story to be told,
G                                 Em                   G 
But I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Am                 Em
Think of me in the depths of your despair
G                         Em                    G    
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
