A#m F# D#m F A#m

[Verse 1]
A#m 
When I was just a little girl 
   F#                        D#m
My mama used to tuck me into bed
          F         A#m
And she'd read me a story
   A#m                         F#
It always was about a princess in distress
                    D#m              F           A#m
And how a guy would save her and end up with her glory

[Pre-Chorus]
    D#m
I'd lie in bed and think about 
    F
The person that I wanted to be
F#
Then one day I realized that 
F              F
Fairy tale life wasn't for me

[Chorus]
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like Cinderella
F#                     F
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar
D#m                     F
Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like someone waiting
F#                       F
For a handsome prince to come and save me
D#m
On I will survive
           F
Unless somebody's on my side
                 F#           F
Don't want to be no no no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

A#m F# D#m F A#m

[Verse 2]
    A#m
Someday I'm gonna find someone that 
F#
Wants me: body, soul, heart, and mind
      D#m           F            A#m
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me
    A#m                          
Somebody who will understand 
    F#
I'm happy just the way I am
      D#m         F           A#m
Don't need nobody taking care of me

[Pre-Chorus]
D#m
I will be there for him 
        F
Just as strong as he will be there for me
F#
When I give myself 
            F            F
Then it has got to be an equal thing

[Chorus]
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like Cinderella
F#                     F
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar
D#m                     F
Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like someone waiting
F#                       F
For a handsome prince to come and save me
D#m
On I will survive
           F
Unless somebody's on my side
                 F#           F
Don't want to be no no no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

A#m F# D#m F A#m

[Bridge]
      C#          G#
I can slay my own dragon
      Fm           A#m
I can dream my own dreams
G#                   Fm       F
My knight in shining armor is me
   F
So I'm gonna set me free, yeah

[Chorus]
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like Cinderella
F#                     F
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar

Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free

I don't want to be like someone waiting

On I will survive
           F
Unless somebody's on my side

[Chorus]
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like Cinderella
F#                     F
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar
D#m                     F
Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free
A#m                     G#
I don't want to be like someone waiting
F#                       F
For a handsome prince to come and save me
D#m
On I will survive
           F
Unless somebody's on my side
