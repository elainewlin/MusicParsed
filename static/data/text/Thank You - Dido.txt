CAPO 1
[Verse 1]
Gm             Eb                  F        
 My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I 
    Bb     F      Gm
got out of bed at all
            Eb                F        
The morning rain clouds up my window,
     Bb      F      Gm
 and I can't see at all
         Eb               F                
And even if I could, it'd all be gray, 
         Bb      F     Gm
but your picture on my wall
     Eb                 Gm               Eb
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2]
Gm           Eb                    F                
 I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, 
   Bb        F        Gm
my head just feels in pain
             Eb                  F               
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, 
    Bb       F     Gm
I'm late for work again
         Eb                   F            
And even if I'm there they'll all imply 
       Bb        F        Gm
that I might not last the day
             Eb               Gm               Eb
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Chorus]
    Bb        Eb
And I want to thank you
                  Bb             Eb
For giving me the best day of my life
    Bb          Eb
And oh, just to be with you
              Dm             Cm
Is having the best day of my life

[Instrumental]
Bb  Eb  Bb  Eb  Bb  Eb  Dm  Cm

[Verse 3]
Bb                          Eb
 Push the door, I'm home at last
                            Bb 
and I'm soaking through and through
                     Eb                     Bb
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
                           Eb                          Dm
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
               Cm
Because you're near me...

[Chorus]
    Bb        Eb
And I want to thank you
                  Bb             Eb
For giving me the best day of my life
    Bb          Eb
And oh, just to be with you
              Dm             Cm
Is having the best day of my life


    Bb        Eb
And I want to thank you
                  Bb             Eb
For giving me the best day of my life
    Bb          Eb
And oh, just to be with you
              Dm             Cm
Is having the best day of my life
