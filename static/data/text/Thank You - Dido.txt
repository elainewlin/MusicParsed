Gm            Eb                   F         Bb      F      Gm
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
            Eb                  F           Bb       F      Gm
The morning rain cloud's up my window, and I can't see at all
         Eb                F                     Bb       F     Gm
And even if I could, it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
     Eb                  Gm                 Eb
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


  Gm         Eb                    F                Bb         F        Gm
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
              Eb                  F                Bb       F      Gm
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
         Eb                     F                 Bb        F        Gm
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
               Eb              Gm                 Eb
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad


    Bb           Eb
And I want to thank you
                   Bb              Eb
For giving me the best day of my life
    Bb           Eb
And oh, just to be with you
              Dm              Cm
Is having the best day of my life

Bb                  Bb        Eb                    Bb             Bb
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
                Bb     Eb              Bb       Bb
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
                      Bb     Eb                           Dm
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
                Cm
Because you're near me...


    Bb           Eb
And I want to thank you
                   Bb              Eb
For giving me the best day of my life
    Bb           Eb
And oh, just to be with you
              Dm              Cm
Is having the best day of my life


    Bb           Eb
And I want to thank you
                   Bb              Eb
For giving me the best day of my life
    Bb           Eb
And oh, just to be with you
              Dm              Cm
Is having the best day of my life
