[Jason]
       C                  Am
Do you hear me talking to you
           Dm7               G         E7
Across the water, across the deep blue ocean
          Am            Dm7
Under the open sky, oh my
            G
Baby I'm trying


[Colbie]
      C              Am
Boy I hear you in my dreams
            Dm7                G   G/F  
I feel your whisper across the sea
           E7            Am
I keep you with me in my heart
            Dm7         G         G#dim
You make it easier when life gets hard


[Both]
Am           Dm7                    G
  Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
            C            Gadd4/B     Am
Lucky to have been where I have been
            Dm7          G Gsus4 G
Lucky to be coming home again
C           Am             Em       G
Oo oo-oo oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo

[Bridge]
Colbie, (Jason)
Dm7                   Am               G
They don't know how   long it takes

 Waiting for a love like this

[Verse]
Jason, (Colbie)
           C                   Am
And so I'm sailing, through the sea
       Dm7                 G 
 To an island, where we'll meet
(To an island, where we'll meet)
                E7              Am
You'll hear the music, fill the air
        Dm7    G
I put a flower in your hair
       (flower)

[Colbie]
               C       C/B         Am
And though the breezes through the trees
        Dm7                  G   G/F
Move so pretty, you're all I see
       E7                  Am
As the world keep spinning round
    Dm7           G           G#dim
You hold me right here, right now

[Both]
Am           Dm7                    G
  Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
            C            Gadd4/B     Am
Lucky to have been where I have been
            Dm7          G G#dim
Lucky to be coming home again
Am             Dm7              G
  Lucky we're in love in every way
          C                C/B       Am
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed

Lucky to be coming home some day
C           Am             Em       G
Oo oo-oo oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo
