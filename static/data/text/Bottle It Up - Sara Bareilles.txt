            Am
There'll be girls across the nation
          E7
That will eat this up babe
  F                                      C         G
I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
    Am
Get down to the heart of it,
E7                           F
No it's my heart you're xxxx out of your luck
              C         G       Am               E7
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love.
F                C   G
Love love love love.
 
    Am                          E7
I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
         F
With her delicate soul
        C             G           Am
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
        E7
To make room for the parts
            F                     C          G
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of 
Am              E7
Love love love love
F               C       G
Love love love love
 
Am          E7                    G
Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
      F
Worth trying to be and it's
 
[Chorus]
C     G     Am    F
Love, love, love, love

            C     G     Am    F
I do it for love, love, love, love
        
      Am                              E7
We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us
        F                           C           G
Oh, but sensible sells so could you kindly shut up
        Am
And get started at keeping
     E7                       F
Your part of the bargain, oh, please little darlin'
       C          G            Am              E7
You're killing me sweetly with love love love love
F               C
Love love love love

 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am          E7                    G
Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
      F
Worth trying to be and it's
 
[Chorus]
C     G     Am    F
Love, love, love, love

            C     G     Am    F
I do it for love, love, love, love
 
[Bridge]
             Am                   E7   
Started as a flicker meant to be a flame
                       G                D7   
Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
                  Dm                   A7   
Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall
                       C
Baby's getting next to nowhere with her back
 G
Against the wall.
                     Am           E7   
You meant to make me happy make me sad.
                       G        D7   
Want to make it better better so bad.
                  Dm              A7   
But save your resolutions for your never new year
                    C                G
There is only one solution I can see here.

Am              E7                     G
Love you're all I ever could need only one good thing
      F
Worth trying to be and it's
 
[Chorus]
C     G     Am    F
Love, love, love, love
            C     G     Am    F
I do it for love, love, love, love
   C               G                  Am    F
Oh, only gonna get get what you give away,
C                G                  Am   F
Only gonna get get what you give away...love.
