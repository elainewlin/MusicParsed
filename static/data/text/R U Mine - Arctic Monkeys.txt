[Verse]

   F#m                            D               Bm
I'm like a puppet on a string, Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond
   F#m                            D               Bm
Coulda shaped heartaches, come to find ya four in some velvet morning
   F#m                            D               Bm
Years too late, she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
   F#m                            D               Bm
Through an open space, in my mind when she's not right there beside me
[Chorus]

     F#m          D                Bm
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
     F#m          D                Bm
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory

     F#m          D                Bm                 F#m D   Bm
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
F#m D   Bm
Are you mine?
F#m D   Bm
Are you mine?
 F#m D   Bm
Are you mine? (Oh are...)

[Verse]

   F#m                            D               Bm
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end, keep imagining meeting,
   F#m                            D               Bm
Wished away entire lifetimes, unfair we're not somewhere
   F#m          D            Bm
Misbehaving for days, great escape
   F#m                            D               Bm
Lost track of time and space, she's a silver lining climbing on my desire
[Chorus]
  F#m          D                Bm
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
     F#m          D                Bm
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
     F#m          D                Bm                 F#m D   Bm
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
F#m D   Bm
Are you mine?
F#m D   Bm
Are you mine?
 F#m D   Bm
Are you mine? (Oh are...)

[Verse]

       Bm                   D                   F#m
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
        A
So in case I'm mistaken,
    Bm       D                 C#    Bm
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
    Am  F#m
Are you mine?

[Verse]

D
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
Bm
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
   F#m                D                      Bm
And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
[Chorus]
  F#m          D                Bm
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
     F#m          D                Bm
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
     F#m          D                Bm                 F#m D   Bm
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
 F#m                D             Bm
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
 F#m                D             Bm
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
 F#m                D             Bm
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?)
