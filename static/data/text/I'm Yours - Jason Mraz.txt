[Verse]
      C
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
  G
I tried to be chill but you’re so hot that I melted
  Am                                     F
I fell right through the cracks, and I’m trying to get back

[Verse]
           C
Before the cool done run out I’ll be giving it my best test
    G
And nothing’s gonna stop me but divine intervention
  Am                           F
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

[Chorus]
    C           G
But I won't hesitate no more,
   Am              F              C
No more, it cannot wait I’m yours

[Verse]
                                    G
Well open up your mind and see like me
                                   Am
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                     F
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
C                                                  G
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
                        Am
We are just one big family
                                   F                         D7
It’s your god forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved

[Chorus]
C               G
So, I won't hesitate no more,
   Am              F
No more, it cannot wait I’m yours 
C                        G                Am
There’s no need to complicate our time is short
            F
This is our fate, I’m yours


[Verse]
          C                       
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    G                      
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
      Am
But my breath fogged up the glass
         F
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
  C                          
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   G                         
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
     Am
It's what we aim to do.
    F
Our name is our virtue.

[Chorus]
    C           G
But I won't hesitate no more,
   Am              F               C
No more, it cannot wait I’m yours

[Verse]
                                    G
Well open up your mind and see like me
                                   Am
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                              F
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   C
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
           G
There's no need to complicate.
           Am
'Cause our time is short.
                              F
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
           D7  C
I'm yours
