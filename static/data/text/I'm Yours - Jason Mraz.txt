[Verse]
      C
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
  G
I tried to be chill but you’re so hot that I melted
  Am                                     F
I fell right through the cracks, and I’m trying to get back

[Verse]
          C
Before the cool done run out I’ll be giving it my best test
    G
And nothing’s gonna stop me but divine intervention
  Am                            F
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

[Chorus]
    C              G
But I won't hesitate no more,
            Am           F
No more, it cannot wait I’m yours

[Verse]
C
Well open up your mind and see like me
G
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Am                                   F
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
C
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
G
We are just one big family
Am                                 F                         D7
It’s your god forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved

[Chorus]
C                 G
So, I won't hesitate no more,
         Am             F
No more, it cannot wait I’m sure
C                             G
There’s no need to complicate our time is short
Am                F
This is our fate, I’m yours

Bridge:
-d-do do you but do you, d-d-do but you want to come one
Scooch one over closer dear and I will nibble your ear
Bap bap bap woooooo ho ho ooooh

[Verse]
C
I've been spending' way too long checking' my tongue in the mirror
G
And bending' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
Am
My breath fogged up the glass
F
And so I drew a new face and laughed
C
I guess what I'm a saying’s there isn’t no better reason
G
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
Am
It’s what we aim to do
F
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
    C              G
But I won't hesitate no more,
            Am           F
No more, it cannot wait I’m yours

[Verse]
     C
Well open up your mind and see like me
G
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Am                                    G
Look into your heart and you'll find, that the sky is yours

     C
So please don’t, don’t please don’t
C
- There’s no need to complicated -
G
Cause our time is short
Am                                  F
This is, this is, this is our fate, I’m yours
