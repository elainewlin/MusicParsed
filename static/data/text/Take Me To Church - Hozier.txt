[Verse 1]
Em              Am    Em                       Am    G
My lover's got humour, she's the giggle at a funeral
                         Am  Em                            Am   Em
Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am       Em                     Am         G
If the Heavens ever did speak, she is the last true mouthpiece
                        Am      Em                 Am      D
Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
                    C                
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
Em                   Am      Em                             Am       G
My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                        Am    Em                   Am      D
The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
               C
I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well

[Chorus]
           Em                                                    B
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Am                    Em                       A5 G5 G5 F#5
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
            Em                                                  B
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                               G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                Am                   Em                         A5 G5 G5 F#5
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
    
[Verse 2]
Em                      Am      Em               Am      G
If I'm a pagan of the good times, my lover's the sunlight
                       Am     Em              Am       D
To keep the Goddess on my side she demands a sacrifice
                       C
To drain the whole sea, get something shiny
Em                       Am        Em                       Am       G
Something meaty for the main course, that's a fine looking high horse
                     Am   Em                         Am     D
What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful
                 C                 C                    C
That looks tasty, that looks plenty, this is hungry work

[Chorus]
           Em                                                    B
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
               Am                    Em                       A5 G5 G5 F#5
Offer me my deathless death, good God, let me give you my life 
             Em                                                  B
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
              Am                   Em                         A5 G5 G5 F#5          
Offer me my deathless death, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
          C         G              B7         Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
        C           G           B7            Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
       C        G            B7        Em  Em/D   Cmaj7   C
Only then I am human, only then I am clean      Oh

           Em                                                    B
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
            Em                                                  B
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                 G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
