[Intro x2]

Dm C Bb F

[Verse 1]

   Dm              C
I know it hurts sometimes but
  Bb             F
You'll get over it
             Dm              C
You'll find another life to live
        Bb              F
I know you'll get over it
   Dm                  C
I know you're sad and tired
            Bb               F
You've got nothing left to give
                 Dm              C
But you'll find another life to live
   Bb                   F
I know you'll get over it


[Chorus]

                Dm            C
So when you're caught in a landslide
           F                     Bb
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
            Dm              C
And in the rain, give you sunshine
           F                     Bb
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
           Dm                C
And every time that you're lonely
        F                       Bb
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
          Dm                      C
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
           F                Bb
I'll be there for you, you know

     Bb             F
Is falling to the wind
              Dm              C
But don't you let the thunder in

[Bridge]

Bb             F
You fell down by the wayside
 C               Dm
Love locked in an overflow
Bb                   F
And you threw stones at the starlight
 C                     Dm
Cause I stood on the sidelines telling you
Bb                      F
That I get that you're lonely
  C                     Dm
And I see that you feel alone
   Bb               F
But I heard in a heartbeat
           C                     Bb
I'll be there here for you, you know


[Chorus]

                Dm            C
So when you're caught in a landslide
           F                     Bb
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
            Dm              C
And in the rain, give you sunshine
           F                     Bb
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
           Dm                C
And every time that you're lonely
        F                       Bb
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
          Dm                      C
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
