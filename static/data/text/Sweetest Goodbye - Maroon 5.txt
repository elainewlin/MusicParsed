Am7                             Dadd9
Where you are it seems to be as far as an eternity

G6                                Em7
Outstreched arms open hearts, and if it never ends then when do we start?

Am7                    Dadd9               G6
I'll never leave you behind or treat you unkind

                Em7
I know you understand

Am7                   Dadd9                         G6
And with a tear in my eye, give me the sweetest goodbye

       Em7
That I ever did receive

C                  B7             Em7
Pushing forward and arching back, bring me closer to heart attack

C                   B7         Em7
Say goodbye and just fly away, when you come back, I have something to say

C                            B7                 Em7
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone, when you get home?

C                                 B7                   Em7
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go,


So I can show you how I...

Am7                  Dadd9
Dream away everyday, try so hard to disregard

    G6 
The rythm of the rain that drops

         Em7
And that coincides with the beating of my heart

Am7                    Dadd9               G6
I'll never leave you behind or treat you unkind

                Em7
I know you understand

Am7                   Dadd9                         G6
And with a tear in my eye, give me the sweetest goodbye

       Em7
That I ever did receive

C                  B7             Em7
Pushing forward and arching back, bring me closer to heart attack

C                   B7         Em7
Say goodbye and just fly away, when you come back, I have something to say

C                            B7                Em7

C                                 B7                   Em7
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go,

Em7
So I can show you how I

C     B7    Em7
Feel, feel, feel, feel
