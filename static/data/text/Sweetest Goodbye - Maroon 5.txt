[Intro]

Am7  D  G  Em


[Verse 1]

Am7                                         D
Where you are seems to be               As far as an eternity
 G                                    Em
Outstretched arms open hearts   And if it never ends then when do we start?


[Pre-Chorus]

Am7                     D                      G
I'll never leave you behind     Or treat you unkind
                      Em
I know you understand
   Am7                       D                        G
Ooh   And with a tear in my eye         Give me the sweetest goodbye


[Chorus]

      Em6                    C                 B
That I ever did receive     Pushing forward and arching back
Em                  Em6
Bring me closer to heart attack
C                     B                Em
Say goodbye and just fly away   When you comeback
   Em6                          C                                 B
I have some things to say       How does it feel to know you never have to be
Em                   Em6
alone    When you get home
C                                  B                  Em
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
   Em6
So I can show you how I...


[Verse 2]

Am7                     D                                   G
Dream away everyday     Try so hard to disregard        The rhythm of the
                      Em                                Am7
rain that drops   And coincides with the beating of my heart


[Pre-Chorus]

                        D                      G
I'll never leave you behind    Or treat you unkind
Em                 Am7
I know you understand       yeeh yeeh yeah
                       D                             G
And with a tear in my eye   Give me the sweetest goodbye
        Em6
That I ever ever ever did receive


[Chorus]

C                   B              Em                 Em6
Pushing forward and arching back    Bring me closer to heart attack
C                    B         Em
Say goodbye and just fly away   When you comeback
  Em6
I have some things to say


[Outro]

C                            B                 Em                 Em6
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone     When you get home
C                                  B                 Em               Em6
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go       So I can show

             C     B    Em   Em6
you how I... Feel  feel  feel  feel
