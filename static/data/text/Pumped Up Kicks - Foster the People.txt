Em                        G
Robert's got a quick hand
D
He'll look around the room
     A
He won't tell you his plan
Em                        G
He's got a rolled cigarette
D
hanging out his mouth
     A
He's a cowboy kid
      Em                       G
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
D
In his dad's closet hidden
     A
in a box of fun things
    Em                   G
And I don't even know what
    D                               A
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you


[Chorus]
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D                 A
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D                 A
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet


[Verse]
Em                    G
Daddy works a long day
   D                              A
He be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
         Em                    G
And he's bringing me a surprise
        D                                A
Because dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
Em                        G
I've waited for a long time
           D                         A
Yeah, the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
  Em                      G
I reason with my cigarette
    D
And say your hair's on fire
     A
You must have lost your wits, yeah


[Chorus]
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
      D                        A
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
      D                       A
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
