Verse:
Em                       G
Robert's got a quick hand
      D                             A
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
Em                    G
Got a rolled cigarette
D                             A  
Hangin' out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
      Em                     G
Yeah, found a six-shooter gun
       D                         A
In his dads closet hidden with a box of fun things
Em                    G
I don't even know what
         D                         A
But he's comin' for you, yeah he's comin for you, hey
 
Chorus x2:
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Outrun my gun
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Faster than my bullet                
 
Verse:
Em                    G
Daddy works a long day
         D                      A
He'll be coming home late, he's coming home late
         Em                    G
And he's bringing me a surprise
     D                                A
Cos' dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
     Em                     G
I've waited for a long time
    D                          A
The slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
  Em                      G
I reason with my cigarette
             D                            A
And say your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits, yeah

You'd better run, better run
A
Faster than my bullet
