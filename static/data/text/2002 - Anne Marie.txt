[Verse 1]
                 E
I will always remember
     E
The day you kissed my lips
             C#m
Light as a feather
        C#m
And it went just like this
                    A
No, it's never been better
              B        E
Than the summer of 2002
              E
We were only eleven
      E
But acting like grownups
                   C#m
Like we are in the present
        C#m
Drinking from plastic cups
                 A              B
Singing love is forever and ever
                       E
Well, I guess that was true


[Pre-Chorus]
  C#m                        A
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
       E            B
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
  A                            B
Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say


[Chorus]
 A      E      B                        C#m
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
          A                          E
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
        B                      C#m
Better hit me, baby, one more time
  A                  E
Paint a picture for you and me
         B                C#m
Of the days when we were young
   A                            B
Singing at the top of both our lungs


[Verse 2]
                      E
Now we're under the covers
       E
Fast forward to eighteen
                   C#m
We are more than lovers
       C#m
Yeah, we are all we need
                    A
When we're holding each other
            B         E
I'm taken back to 2002

Yeah


[Pre-Chorus]
  C#m                        A
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
       E             B
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
  A                            B 
Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say


[Chorus]
 A      E        B                       C#m
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
         A                            E
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
        B                       C#m
Better hit me, baby, one more time
  A                  E
Paint a picture for you and me
         B                 C#m
Of the days when we were young
  A                             B
Singing at the top of both our lungs
                        E  B  C#m A
On the day we fell in love
                        E  B  C#m A
On the day we fell in love


[Pre-Chorus]
   C#m                          A 
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
        E            B 
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
  A                            B 
Songs with all our childhood friends

Oh, now


[Chorus]
  A     E      B                         C#m
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
          A                           E
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
        B                       C#m
Better hit me, baby, one more time
  A                  E
Paint a picture for you and me
        B                  C#m
Of the days when we were young
  A                              B
Singing at the top of both our lungs
                        E  B  C#m A
On the day we fell in love
                        E  B  C#m A
On the day we fell in love
                        E  B  C#m A
On the day we fell in love
                        E  B  C#m A
On the day we fell in love
                        A
On the day we fell in love, love, love
