[Intro x2]

Fmaj7 Dm Fmaj7 Dm C

[Verse]

Dm                   F
I want to live where soul meets body
Dm                       F
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
Dm                         F
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
    C     C                         Dm
And feel, feel what it's like to be new

                           F
Cause in my head there’s a greyhound station
       Dm                   F
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
   Dm                        F
So they may have a chance of finding a place
              C
where they’re far more suited than here

Dm F Dm F Dm F C
Ba ba ba ~

[Pre-Chorus]
Dm                  F
I cannot guess what we'll discover
Dm                        F
We turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
      Dm                        F
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another’s
    C
And not one speck will remain

[Chorus]

Dm   F            C
I do believe it’s true
               Dm            F           C
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
       Dm            F
If the silence takes you
       C
Then I hope it takes me too
Dm F C

   Dm           F        C
So brown eyes I hold you near
                 Dm          F       C
Cause you’re the only song I want to hear
      Dm        F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Dm F C

[Bridge]

      Dm              Dm
Where soul meets body                     
      F       
Where soul meets body
C                     C
Where soul meets body

[Chorus]

Dm   F            C
I do believe it’s true
               Dm            F           C
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
       Dm            F
If the silence takes you
       C
Then I hope it takes me too

Dm F C
   Dm           F        C
So brown eyes I hold you near
                 Dm          F       C
Cause you’re the only song I want to hear
      Dm        F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
Dm F C

[Outro]
Fmaj7 Dm Fmaj7 Dm
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere       
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
