[Verse]

A      E                   F#m
Let me know that I've done wrong
          D
When I've known this all along
A    E                F#m
I go around a time or two
        D
Just to waste my time with you


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm                             F#m
Tell me all that you've thrown away
                               D
Find out games you don't wanna play
                 E
You are the only one that needs to know


[Chorus]

A                D            F#m           E
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
           A                   D            F#m
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret 
                      E
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
   D
My dirty little secret

Who has to know


[Verse]

A       E                 F#m
When we live such fragile lives
         D                  A
It's the best way we survive
     E                F#m
I go around a time or two
        D
Just to waste my time with you


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm                             F#m
Tell me all that you've thrown away
                               D
Find out games you don't wanna play
                 E
You are the only one that needs to know


[Chorus]

A                D            F#m           E
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
           A                   D            F#m
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
                      E
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
   D
My dirty little secret

Who has to know


F#m                         D
The way she feels inside (inside)
                             F#m
Those thoughts I can't deny (deny)
                             D
These sleeping dogs won't lie (won't lie)

And now I'll try to lie
F#m
Itâ€™s eating me apart
D
Trace this life out


[Interlude]

A                D            F#m          E
I'll keep you my dirty little secret(Dirty little secret)
           A                   D            F#m
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret(Just another regret)


[Chorus]

A                D            F#m          E
I'll keep you my dirty little secret(Dirty little secret)
           A                   D            F#m
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
                      E
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
   D            F#m
My dirty little secret
D            F#m
Dirty little secret
D            A
Dirty little secret

Who has to know
