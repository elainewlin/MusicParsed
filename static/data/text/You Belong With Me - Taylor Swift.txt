[Verse 1]
G                                                 D
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                         Am
She's going off about something that you said
                                       C
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
G                                       D
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night
                                                Am
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
                                      C
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
    Am                      C
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
G                       D
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Am                              C
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                D
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
             G
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
D                                     Am
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                C                   G
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
G                                               D
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
                                              Am
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
                                        C
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself isn't this easy?
    G                                                 D
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
                                                   Am
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
Am
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
C
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Am                    C
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
G                      D
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Am                     C
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                D
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
             G
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
D                                     Am
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                C
You belong with me

G
Standing by and waiting at your back door
D                                        Am
All this time how could you not know, baby
                C
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
                   Am
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
       C
In the middle of the night
        G
I'm the one who makes you laugh
         D
When you know you're about to cry
      Am
And I know your favorite songs
        C
And you tell me about your dreams
        G
Think I know where you belong
        D
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
          G
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
D                                     Am
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                C
You belong with me
G
Standing by and waiting at your back door
D                                        Am
All this time how could you not know, baby
                C                   G
You belong with me, you belong with me
                D
You belong with me
                              Am
Have you ever thought just maybe
                C                   G
You belong with me, you belong with me
