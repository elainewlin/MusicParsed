Do you want to build a snowman?
                     G
Come on let's go and play
                Am7
I never see you anymore
     F
Come out the door,
                      G
It's like you've gone away
                   Am7
We used to be best buddies
    C
And now we're not
  Am7            E7       F
I wish you would tell me why
                       C
Do you want to build a snowman?
                        F
It doesn't have to be a Snowman

Young Elsa: Go away, Anna
                     C
Toddler Anna: Okay, bye

Do you wanna build a snowman?
                              G
Or ride our bike around the halls
                          Am7
I think some company is overdue
                F                             G
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls
(Hang in there, Joan)
                   Am7
It gets a little lonely
                  C
All these empty rooms
         Am7        E7        F
Just watching the hours tick by
(Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock)


                           C
Elsa, please, I know you're in there
                               G
People are asking where you've been
                                      Am7
They say have courage, and I'm trying to
                        F                G
I'm right out here for you, just let me in
              Am7
We only have each other
           C
It's just you and me
Am7           E7    F
What are we gonna do?
                        C
Do you wanna build a snowman?
