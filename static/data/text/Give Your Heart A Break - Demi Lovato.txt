[Verse 1]
A         E
The day I first met you
C#m         B
You told me you'd never fall in love
A            E
But now that I get you
C#m         B
I know fear is what it really was


[Prechorus]

A                 E
Now here we are, so close
C#m         B
Yet so far, haven't I passed the test?
A             E C#m
When will you realize
B
Baby, I'm not like the rest


[Chorus]

A
Don't wanna break your heart
E
I wanna give your heart a break
C#m
I know you're scared it's wrong
B
Like you might make a mistake
A
There's just one life to live
E                            C#m
And there's no time to waste, to waste
B
So let me give your heart a break
A
Give your heart a break
E
Let me give your heart a break
C#m
Your heart a break

B
Oh, yeah yeah


[Verse 2]

A          E            C#m
On Sunday, you went home alone
B
There were tears in your eyes
A             E          C#m
I called your cell phone, my love
B
But you did not reply


[Prechorus 2]

A                  E
The world is ours, if you want it
C#m             B
We can take it, if you just take my hand
A              E        C#m
There's no turning back now
B
Baby, try to understand


[Chorus]

A
Don't wanna break your heart
E
I wanna give your heart a break
C#m
I know you're scared it's wrong
B
Like you might make a mistake
A
There's just one life to live
E                            C#m
And there's no time to waste, to waste
B
So let me give your heart a break
A
Give your heart a break
E
Let me give your heart a break
C#m
Your heart a break

B
Oh, yeah yeah


[Bridge]

A                     B
When your lips are on my lips
E                    A
And our hearts beat as one
         C#m                      B
But you slip right out of my fingertips
E             A E C#m B
Every time you run, whoa


[Chorus] x2

A
Don't wanna break your heart
E
I wanna give your heart a break
C#m
I know you're scared it's wrong
B
Like you might make a mistake
A
There's just one life to live
E                            C#m
And there's no time to waste, to waste
B
So let me give your heart a break
A
Give your heart a break
E
Let me give your heart a break
C#m
Your heart a break

B
Oh, yeah yeah


A         E
The day I first met you
C#m         B
You told me you'd never fall in love
