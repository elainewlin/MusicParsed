[Verse 1]
C
Sid Vicious played a four-string Fender
C7
bass guitar and couldn’t sing
    Fsus2
And everybody hated him
G7sus4               G7
except the ones who loved him
C
A ukulele has four strings,
C7
but Sid did not play ukulele
Fsus2
He did smack and probably killed his
G7sus4           G7
girlfriend Nancy Spungen

[Verse 2]
C                        C7
If only Sid had had a ukulele,
                         Fsus2
maybe he could have been happy
                        G7sus4          G7
Maybe he would not have suffered such a sad end
   C
He maybe would have not done all that
C7
heroin instead he maybe
Fsus2
would’ve sat around just singing
G7sus4            G7
nice songs to his girlfriend

[Chorus]
   C
So play your favorite cover song,
C7
especially if the words are wrong
Fsus2
Cos even if your grades are bad,
G7sus4                 G7
it doesn’t mean you’re failing
C
Do your homework with a fork
    C7
and eat your fruit loops in the dark
Fsus2
And bring your etch-a-sketch to work
    G7sus4       G7
and play your ukulele

[Bridge]
Fsus2
Ukulele small and forceful,
G7
ukulele, brave and peaceful
C
You can play the ukulele too
          Fsus2
it is painfully simple
Fsus2
Play your ukulele badly,
G7
play your ukulele loudly
Bb6
Ukulele banish evil, ukulele save the people,
Bb6
Ukulele gleaming golden from the top of every steeple

[Verse 3]
C
Lizzie borden took an axe,
    C7
and gave her mother forty whacks
     Fsus2
Then gave her father forty-one,
    G7sus4        G7
and left a tragic puzzle
C
If only they had given her
    C7
an instrument, those puritans
    Fsus2
Had lost the plot completely,
         G7sus4           G7
see what happens when you muzzle

[Verse 4]
C
A person’s creativity
C7
and do not let them sing and scream
Fsus2
And nowadays it’s worse ‘cause kids have
G7sus4    G7
automatic handguns
C
It takes about an hour to teach
C7
someone to play the ukulele
Fsus2
About same to teach someone to
G7sus4           G7
build a standard pipe bomb
N.C: you do the math!

[Chorus]
   C
So play your favorite cover song,
C7
especially if the words are wrong
Fsus2
Cos even if your grades are bad,
G7sus4                 G7
it doesn’t mean you’re failing
C
Do your homework with a fork
    C7
and eat your fruit loops in the dark
Fsus2
And bring your etch-a-sketch to work
    G7sus4       G7
and play your ukulele

[Bridge]
Fsus2
Ukulele, thing of wonder,
G7
Ukulele, wand of thunder
C
You can play the ukulele too
Fsus2
in London and down under
Fsus2
Play Joan Jett, and play Jacques Brel and
G7
Eminem and Neutral Milk Ho-
Bb6
Tell the children crush the hatred, play your ukulele naked
Bb6
If anybody tries to steal your ukulele, let them take it

[Verse 5]
C
Imagine there’s no music,
C7
imagine there are no songs
Fsus2
Imagine that John Lennon wasn’t shot
   G7sus4         G7
in front of his apartment
C C7 Fsus2
Now imagine if John Lennon had
C7                         Fsus2
composed “Imagine” for the ukulele
                        G7sus4        G7
Maybe people would have truly got the message

[Verse 6]
C
You may think my approach is simple-
C7
minded and naïve
Fsus2
Like if you want to change the world then why not
G7sus4             G7
quit and feed the hungry
C
But people for millennia have
C7
needed music to survive
Fsus2
And that’s why I’ve promised John that
G7sus4          G7
I will not feel guilty

[Verse 7]
C
So play your favorite Beatles song
    C7
and make the subway fall in love
Fsus2
They’re only $19.95
     G7sus4        G7
that isn’t lots of money
C
Play until the sun comes up and
C7
play until your fingers suffer
Fsus2
Play LCD Soundsystem songs
G7sus4 G7
on your ukulele

[Verse 8]
C
Quit the bitching on your blog and
C7
stop pretending art is hard
Fsus2
Just limit yourself to three chords and
G7sus4          G7
do not practice daily
C
You’ll minimize some stranger’s sadness
C7
with a piece of wood and plastic
Fsus2
Holy fuck it’s so fantastic,
G7sus4  G7
playing ukulele

[Verse 9]
C
Eat your homework with a fork and
C7
do your fruit loops in the dark
Fsus2
And bring your etch-a-sketch to work,
your flask of jack, your vibrator
your fear of heights, your nikon lens

[Verse 10]
C
Your mom and dad, your disco stick,
C7
your soundtrack from “Karate Kid”
Fsus2
Your ginsu knives, your rosary,
     G7sus4      G7
your new Rebecca Black CD
C
Your favorite room, your bowie knife,
C7
your stuffed giraffe, your new glass eye
Fsus2
Your sousaphone, your breakfast tea,
    G7sus4                  G7
your Nick Drake tapes, your giving tree
C
Your ice cream truck, your missing wife,
C7
your will to live, your urge to
cry
Fsus2
Remember we’re all going to die
C
so play your ukulele
