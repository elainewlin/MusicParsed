[Verse]

Dsus2             F#m7
Sat back with the window down
A5                 Bm7add4
80 an hour and the radio loud
 Dsus2                  F#m7
The same songs with the same old rhymes
A5                          Bm7add4
Told me to shake it off and swing from the lights
            Dsus2                    F#m7
But I can’t help it drive away from all the mess you made
    A5                       Bm7add4
You sent this hurricane now it won’t go away
      Dsus2                      F#m7
And I promised I’d be there but you don’t make it easy
A5                      Bm7add4
Darling please believe me

[Chorus]

      Bm7add4            A
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard,
F#m             E
All I do, all I do’s not enough
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you
            F#m                E
I cannot be loving you, loving you, ooh-oh-a-oh-a
Bm7add4            A
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
F#m             E
All I do, all I do is get burned
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you,
            F#m                E                       D6
I cannot be loving you, loving you, ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh

[Verse]

Dsus2               F#m7
Count stacks of the routine lights,
A5                       Bm7add4
Funny how easy you could see my blind side
          Dsus2               F#m7
Still the same songs with the same old beats
A5                              Bm7add4
Sure I could stay but there’s a place I’d rather be
            Dsus2                   F#m7
And I can’t help it drive away from all the mess you made
    A5                      Bm7add4
You sent this hurricane now it won’t go away
      Dsus2                        F#m7
And I promised I’d be there but you don’t make it easy
A5                     Bm7add4
Darling please believe me

[Chorus]

      Bm7add4            A
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard,
F#m             E
All I do, all I do’s not enough
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you
            F#m                E
I cannot be loving you, loving you, ooh-oh-a-oh-a
Bm7add4            A
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
F#m             E
All I do, all I do is get burned
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you,
            F#m                E                       
I cannot be loving you, loving you, ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh

[Bridge]

D                                 F#m                 A
See I remember all the times you made me, covered in crazy
D                       F#m     A
Can’t forget about the way you played me,
            Bm                      D
Like I was never gonna change your world
          F#m  A       Bm                 D          
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
          F#m  A       Bm                 
It ended long ago, so please just let me go

[Chorus]

Bm7add4            A
Loving you, loving you is too hard,
F#m             E
All I do, all I do’s not enough
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you
            F#m                E
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Bm7add4            A
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
F#m             E
All I do, all I do is get burned
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you,
            F#m                E                       
I cannot be loving you, loving you, ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh

[Post-Chorus]

Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you
F#m             E
All I do, all I do
Bm7add4     A
Loving you, loving you, oh-ooh-oh
F#m          E                             Bm7add4  A F#m E
Loving you, loving you, ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh
                   Bm7add4  A F#m E
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh
