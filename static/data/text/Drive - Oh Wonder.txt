[Verse]

Em
Sat back with the window down
                   Am
80 an hour and the radio loud
Em
The same songs with the same old rhymes
G                             D
Told me to shake it off and swing from the lights
            Am                 G
But I can’t help it drive away from all the mess you made
                        D
You sent this hurricane now it won’t go away
      Am                    G
And I promised I’d be there but you don’t make it easy
                       D
Darling please believe me
[Chorus]

      Am           Em
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard,
G             D
All I do, all I do’s not enough
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you
            G             D
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
G             D
All I do, all I do is get burned
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you,
            G             D
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Am
[Verse]

Em
Count stacks of the routine lights,
                         Am
Funny how easy you could see my blind side
        Em
Still the same songs with the same old beats
G                                 D
Sure I could stay but there’s a place I’d rather be
   Am                 G
But I can’t help it drive away from all the mess you made
                        D
You sent this hurricane now it won’t go away
      Am                    G
And I promised I’d be there but you don’t make it easy
                       D
Darling please believe me
[Chorus]

      Am           Em
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard,
G             D
All I do, all I do’s not enough
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you
            G             D
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
G             D
All I do, all I do is get burned
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you,
            G             D
I cannot be loving you, loving you
[Bridge]

Am        Em                       G                   D
See I remember all the times you made me, covered in crazy
Am          Em                   G
Can’t forget about the way you played me,
           D                       Am
Like I was never gonna change your world
   Em          G      D                    Am
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
   Em          G      D
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
[Chorus]

      Am           Em
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard,
G             D
All I do, all I do’s not enough
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you
            G             D
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
G             D
All I do, all I do is get burned
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you,
            G             D
I cannot be loving you, loving you
[Post-Chorus]

Am            Em
Loving you, loving you
G             D
All I do, all I do
Am            Em
Loving you, loving you, oohhh
G             D
Loving you, loving you
