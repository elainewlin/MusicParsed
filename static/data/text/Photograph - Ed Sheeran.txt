Intro: 
C  Am  G  F

Verse:
           C
Loving can hurt
           Am
Loving can hurt sometimes
             G                     F
But it's the only thing that I know


             C
When it gets hard
                    Am
you know it can get hard sometimes
          G                                 F
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive

Pre-Chorus:
Am                           F
We keep this love in a photograph
C                       G
We made these memories for ourselves
          Am
where our eyes are never closing
     F
our hearts were never broken
     C                        G
and times are forever frozen still

Chorus:
           C
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
G
ripped jeans holdin' me closer til our
Am                          F
eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
                         C
Wait for me to come home

Verse:
           C
Loving can heal
           Am
Loving can mend your soul
             G                      F
And it's the only thing that I know -know-


                    C
I swear it will get easier
                             Am
remember that with every piece of ya
             G                                    F
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Pre-Chorus:
Am                           F
We keep this love in a photograph
C                       G
We made these memories for ourselves
          Am
where our eyes are never closing
     F
our hearts were never broken
     C                      G
and times forever frozen still

Chorus:
           C
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
G
ripped jeans holdin' me closer til our
Am                          F
eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
           C
And if you hurt me well that's ok baby only
G
words bleed inside these pages you just
Am                              F
hold me and I won't ever let you go

Bridge:
                     Am
Wait for me to come home
                     F
Wait for me to come home
                     C
Wait for me to come home
                     G
Wait for me to come home

Chorus:
            C
Oh you can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were
G
sixteen next to your heartbeat where I
Am                                 F
should be, keep it deep within your soul
           C
And if you hurt me well that's ok baby only
G
words bleed inside these pages you just
Am                              F
hold me and I won't ever let you go

Outro:
          C
When I'm away I will remember how you
G                                     Am
kissed me under the lamppost back on 6th Street
                                 F
hearing you whisper through the phone
N.C.
Wait for me to come home
