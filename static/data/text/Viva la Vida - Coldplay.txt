[Verse 1]
          F        G
I used to rule the world 
           C                    Am
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
                      F     G
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
          C                 Am
Sweep the streets I used to own
  
[Verse 2]
          F         G
I used to roll the dice 
          C                 Am
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
              F            G
Listen as the crowd would sing,
          C                 Am
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
 
[Pre-chorus]
            F        G
One minute I held the key 
         C                    Am
Next the walls were closed on me 
                          F        G
And I discovered that my castles stand 
     C                    Am
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 

[Chorus]
  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   C                 Am
My missionaries in a foreign field 
F                 G
For some reason I can't explain 
C                     Am              F      G
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
         C               Am 
That was when I ruled the world 
 
[Verse 3]
                      F     G
It was the wicked and wild wind 
              C               Am
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
                          F        G
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
       C                    Am
People couldn't believe what I'd become


[Pre-chorus]
          F      G
Revolutionaries wait 
        C               Am
For my head on a silver plate 
                   F      G
Just a puppet on a lonely string
   C                         Am
Oh who would ever want to be king? 

[Chorus]
  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   C                 Am
My missionaries in a foreign field 
F                 G
For some reason I can't explain 
  C                     Am              
I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
         F      G 
never an honest word
              C               Am 
But that was when I ruled the world  
 
[Chorus]
  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   C                 Am
My missionaries in a foreign field 
F                 G
For some reason I can't explain 
  C                     Am              
I know Saint Peter will call my name,
         F      G 
never an honest word
             C                Am 
But that was when I ruled the world
