Bm                  D                Bm               D
You were my conscience, so solid now you're like water
Bm                     D              Bm                D
And weï»¿ started drowning, not like we'd sink any farther
Bm              D             Bm                    D
But I let my heart go, it's somewhere down at the bottom
Bm               D                    Bm                         D
But I'll get a new one and come back for the hope that you've stolen

 
[Chorus]
Bm             D           Bm             D               Em
I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world from turning into
          A
a monster eating us alive
               Bm     D      Bm    D
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
                     Em           A     Bm
Well now that you're gone, the world is ours
 
[Verse]
Bm        D     Bm           D
I'm only human, I've got a skeleton in me
Bm              D       Bm               D
but I'm not the villain despite what you're always preaching
Bm           D         Bm             D
Call me a traitor, I'm just collecting your victims
Bm                  D        Bm          Em
And they're getting stronger I hear them calling.
 
[Chorus]
Bm             D           Bm             D               Em
I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world from turning into
          A
a monster eating us alive
               Bm     D      Bm    D
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
                     Em           A     Bm
Well now that you're gone, the world is ours

[Bridge]
Em                       A            D                  A
Will you find a straight disillusion, well I like the tension
Em                 A
And not always knowing the answers
D            A
You're gonna lose it
D            Em
You're gonna lose it
 
[Chorus]
Bm             D           Bm             D               Em
I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world from turning into
          A
a monster eating us alive
               Bm     D      Bm    D
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
                     Em           A     Bm
Well now that you're gone, the world is ours

Bm             D           Bm             D               Em
I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world from turning into
          A
a monster eating us alive
               Bm     D      Bm    D
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
                     Em           A     Bm
Well now that you're gone, the world is ours
