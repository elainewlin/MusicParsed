[Verse 1]
E                                    F#m
I've been staring at the edge of the water
                 C#m                      A
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
E                             F#m
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                       C#m                         A
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
      C#m
Every turn I take, every trail I track
      B
Every path I make, every road leads back
       E
To the place I know, where I can not go
         Am
Where I long to be

[Chorus]
        E                                      B
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           C#m                A
And no one knows, how far it goes
       E                                    B
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             C#m         Am                   
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Verse 2]
E                        F#m                           C#m
I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                A
Everything is by design
E                         F#m                       C#m
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
                       A
So maybe I can roll with mine
      C#m
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
        B
I'll be satisfied if I play along
        E
But the voice inside sings a different song
        Am
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus] 
        E                                      B
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
           C#m                 A
But no one knows, how deep it goes
       E                                             B
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
           C#m             A
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

[Chorus]
         F                                      C
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           Dm                A#
And no one knows, how far it goes
       F                                    C
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             Dm                 G# Fm C                  
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
