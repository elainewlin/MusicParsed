[Verse 1]
E5                                   F#msus4
I've been staring at the edge of the water
                 C#m                      Asus2
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
E5                            F#msus4
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                       C#m                         Asus2
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
      C#m
Every turn I take, every trail I track
      Bsus2/D#
Every path I make, every road leads back
       E
To the place I know, where I cannot go
        Am6
Where I long to be

[Chorus]
        E                                      Bsus4
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
    B      C#m7               Asus2
And no one knows, how far it goes
       E                                    Bsus4
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             C#m9       Am
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Verse 2]
E5                        F#m7sus4                      C#m7
I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                    Asus2
Everything is by design
E                         F#m7sus4                  C#m
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
               E/B        A    E
So maybe I can roll with mine
      C#m
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
        Bsus2/D#
I'll be satisfied if I play along
        E
But the voice inside sings a different song
        Am              Am6
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus]
        E                                      Bsus4
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
    B      C#m7               Asus2
But no one knows, how deep it goes
       E                                           Bsus4
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
    B      C#m7            A                     A6
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

[Chorus]
        F                                     Csus4
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
    C      Dm                Bb    Bb/C
And no one knows, how far it goes
       F                                   Csus4
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
    C        Dm   Dm/C          Ab    Fm Dbdim C
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
