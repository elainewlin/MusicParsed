[Verse 1]
Dmaj7
It all became so lovely
Em
Those bluest skies above me
Gm                         D/F#       Fmaj7
Those funny feelings I had never felt before I met you
Dmaj7
I thought I'd stay a while
Em7
I tried to learn to smile
Gm7                  D/F#       B7
So many colors I had never even known

[Refrain 1]
Em          A                  F#m             Fdim
Maybe I'll find myself sitting on that distant shore
Em        Gm  A D
Maybe I'm not alone

[Verse 2]
Bb
Then I see the colors fading
D
Gentleness of light escaping
Bb                                  C              A
Shadows of my fear invading, have I seen this all before?
Dmaj7
I know that there's something residing
Em7
A terror deep inside me
Gm7                       D/F#            B7
I couldn't understand how you could be so bold

[Refrain 2]
Em         A                   F#m             Fdim
Maybe I'll find myself smiling on that distant shore
Em        Gm  A D
Maybe I'm not alone
