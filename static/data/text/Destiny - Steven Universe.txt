Do you believe in destiny?

Em                            Bm        
Close your eyes and leave the rest to me

Bm                F#7     
Do you believe in fantasy?

Em                           Bm             
I have to when it's right in front of me, oh

G            A     D     D7          G     
What are you doing here, in the real world?

             F#    Bm       D                       
What are you doing here, so close I could touch you?

G            A     D         Bb                    A  
What are you doing here, and what are you doing to me?
