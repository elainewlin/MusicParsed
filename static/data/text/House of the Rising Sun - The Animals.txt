[Verse 1]

      Am   C        D           F
There is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E7  E7
They call the Risin' Sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
    Am     E7       Am
And God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor.
    Am       C        E7    E7
She sewed my new blue jeans.
   Am     C     D        F
My father was a gamblin' man
Am      E7     Am
Down in New Or-leans.

         Am   C       D       F
Now, the only thing a gambler needs
     Am       C     E7    E7
Is a suitcase and a trunk
        Am   C         D          F
And the only time that he's satisfied
   Am        E7   Am
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh, Mother, tell your children
       Am      C      E7    E7
Not to do what I have done.
Am         C        D          F
Spend your lives in sin and misery
       Am           E7     Am
In the house of the risin' sun.

the other foot on the train.

I'm goin' back to New Orleans

To wear that ball and chain.
