[Rapunzel]

C 
All those days
G                 C   
Watching from the windows
C
All those years
G               C 
Outside looking in
F
All that time 
C          G
Never even knowing
C        Am         G
Just how blind I've been

C
Now I'm here
G               C
Blinking in the starlight
C
Now I'm here
G          C
Suddenly I see
F
Standing here
     Em
It's oh, so clear
    Dm                 G
I'm where I'm meant to be

       F               C
And at last, I see the light
         G                C
And it's like the fog has lifted
       F               C
And at last, I see the light
         Em              Am
And it's like the sky is new
         F                 C
And it's warm and real and bright
        Em                F
And the world has somehow shifted
C
All at once
G                C
Everything looks different
F        G     C
Now that I see you

All those days
Bb             Eb
Chasing down a daydream
Eb
All those years

Living in a blur
Ab
All that time
Eb          Bb
Never truly seeing
Eb                  Bb
Things the way they were
Eb
Now she's here
Bb             Eb
Shining in the starlight
Eb
Now she's here
Bb         Eb
Suddenly I know
Ab
If she's here
     Gm
It's crystal clear
    Fm                 Bb
I'm where I'm meant to go
