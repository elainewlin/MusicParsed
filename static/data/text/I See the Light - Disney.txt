C 
All those days
G7/C                 C   
Watching from the windows
C
All those years
G7/C               C 
Outside looking in
F
All that time 
C          F   G
Never even knowing
C        D         G7
Just how blind I've been

C
Now I'm here
G7/C               C
Blinking in the starlight
C
Now I'm here
G7/C          C
Suddenly I see
F
Standing here
     Em
It's oh, so clear
    Am        D7      Gsus4 
I'm where I'm meant to be

       F               C
And at last, I see the light
         Gsus4    Dm7/G      C
And it's like the fog has lifted
       F               C
And at last, I see the light
         Esus4   E7    Am
And it's like the sky is new
         F                 C
And it's warm and real and bright
        Em                F
And the world has somehow shifted
C
All at once
G7/C              C
Everything looks different
F        G     C
Now that I see you

All those days
Bb7/Eb             Eb
Chasing down a daydream
Eb
All those years
Bb7/Eb      Eb
Living in a blur
Ab
All that time
Eb          Ab Bb
Never truly seeing
Eb         F         Bb7
Things the way they were
Eb
Now she's here
Bb             Eb
Shining in the starlight
Eb
Now she's here
Bb         Eb
Suddenly I know
Ab
If she's here
     Gm
It's crystal clear
    Cm       F7        Bbsus4
I'm where I'm meant to go
