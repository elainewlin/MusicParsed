CAPO 3


[INTRO]
G  D  Em  C  G  D  G  C G

                 D        Em
I’ve never had a way with women
        C            G        D           G      C G
But the hills of Iowa make me wish that I could
                       D            Em
And I’ve never found a way to say I love you
    C                  G      D    G      C G
But if the chance came by, oh I, I would


        Em                         C             G
But way back where I come from, we never mean to bother
         C                Am             D
We don’t like to make our passions other peoples' concern
       G           D             Em
And we walk in the world of safe people
       C               G      D          G    C G
And at night we walk into our houses and burn


[CHORUS]
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa
 

              D                     Em
How I long to fall just a little bit
   C                G         D              G      C G
To dance out of the lines and stray from the light
                   D                 Em
But I fear that to fall in love with you
      C           G         D        G      C G
Is to fall from a great and gruesome height


               Em                            C    
So you know, I asked a friend about it, on a bad day
                  G
Her husband had just left her
    C           Am               D    
She sat down on the chair he left behind
         G         D                  Em
She said, "What is love, where did it get me?"
    C               G       D            G     C G
"Whoever thought of love is no friend of mine"


[CHORUS]
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa


[INTERLUDE]
G    Em  G  C  G    C G


                D                  Em
Once I had everything, I gave it up 
        C                G                D                G    C G
For the shoulder of your driveway and the words I’ve never felt
                            D              Em
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks
    C               G               D      G     
Ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and I’d do it again


      Em                               C                  G
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion
      Am                               D                      C
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see
                         G      G/F#     Em  
You were a-wandering out on the hills of Iowa
    C            Am          D    
And you were not thinking of me


[BRIDGE]
             G 
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh
  D   Em   C   G   D    G    C G
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I-I, Iowa


[CHORUS]
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa


[CHORUS]
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa
         D  
Iowa, oh ooh
  Em      C          G    D  G    C  G
Iowa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I-Iowa
