[VERSE]

       Am
Are we crazy?
                   Dm     
Living our lives through a lens
                      F           
Trapped in our white picket fence, like ornaments
   C                  
So comfortable, we’re living in a bubble, bubble
   Em
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

           Am
Aren't you lonely?
             Dm           
Up there in utopia
                        F        
Where nothing will ever be enough

Happily numb
   C                  
So comfortable, we’re living in a bubble, bubble
   Em
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble


[PRE-CHORUS]

F    Dm  C
      So put
                   Am
Your rose-colored glasses on
    Em
And party on


[CHORUS]

Am
Turn it up, it’s your favorite song

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Dm
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
                                   F
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

YEAH! We think we’re free, drink, this one’s on me
      C                          Em                                
We’re all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm

Am
Turn it up, it’s your favorite song

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Dm
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
                                   F
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

YEAH! We think we’re free, drink, this one’s on me
      C                          Em                        Am                                   
We’re all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm


[VERSE]

        Am
Are we tone deaf?
                   Dm           
Keep sweeping it under the mat
 F                      F             
Thought we could do better than that
  F            
I hope we can
   C                  
So comfortable, we’re living in a bubble, bubble
   Em
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble


[PRE-CHORUS]

F    Dm  C
      So put
                  Am
Your rose-colored glasses on
    Em
And party on


[CHORUS]

Am
Turn it up, it’s your favorite song

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Dm
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
                                   F
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

YEAH! We think we’re free, drink, this one’s on me
      C                          Em                                
We’re all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm

Am
Turn it up, it’s your favorite song

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Dm
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
                                   F
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

YEAH! We think we’re free, drink, this one’s on me
      C                          Em                                                           
We’re all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm


[BRIDGE]

Dm           Em
    It is my desire
F                                G
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Am
   Up in your high place, liars
G
Time is ticking for the empire
Dm                     Em
The truth they feed is feeble
F                        G
As so many times before
Am
The greed over the people
     G
They stumbling and fumbling and we about to riot
     G
They woke up, they woke up the lions


[CHORUS]

Am
Turn it up, it’s your favorite song

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Dm
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
                                   F
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

YEAH! We think we’re free, drink, this one’s on me
      C                          Em                                                           
We’re all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm

        Am
It goes on, and on, and on
        Dm
It goes on, and on, and on
        F                           
It goes on, and on, and on
             C    Em    
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
