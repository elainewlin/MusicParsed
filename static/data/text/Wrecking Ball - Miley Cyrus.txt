[Verse]

Bm                D       
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
A                    G
We jumped, never asking why
Bm                             D   
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A                    G 
A love no one could deny

Bm                             D      
Dont you ever say I just walked away
A                    G
I will always want you
Bm                             D   
I cant live a lie, running for my life
A                    G
I will always want you


[Chorus]
                      D              A
I came in like a wrecking ball
Bm                    G
I never hit so hard in love
              D              A 
All I wanted was to break your walls
Bm                    G
All you ever did was break me
Bm                G
Yeah, you wreck me


[Verse]

Bm                       D      
I put you high up in the sky
        A                       G
And now, youre not coming down
   Bm                       D  
It slowly turned, you let me burn
       A                             G
And now, we’re ashes on the ground

Bm                          D  
Dont you ever say I just walked away
A                 G
I will always want you
Bm                          D  
I cant live a lie, running for my life
A                 G
I will always want you


[Chorus]

                      D         A
I came in like a wrecking ball
Bm                    G
I never hit so hard in love
              D              A 
All I wanted was to break your walls
Bm                    G
All you ever did was break me
Bm                G
Yeah, you wreck me

                      D         A
I came in like a wrecking ball
Bm                    G
I never hit so hard in love
              D              A 
All I wanted was to break your walls
Bm                    G
All you ever did was break me
Bm                G
Yeah, you wreck me


[Bridge]

                          Bm                           
I never meant to start a war
                               D
I just wanted you to let me in
                            F#m
And instead of using force
                           G
I guess I should’ve let you in
                            Bm
I never meant to start a war
                                D
I just wanted you to let me in
                           F#m
I guess I should’ve let you in

Bm                               D
Dont you ever say I just walked away
A                          G
I will always want you


[Chorus]

D                               A
I came in like a wrecking ball
                  Bm         G
I never hit so hard in love
                       D             A
All I wanted was to break your walls
                        Bm      G
All you ever did was break me
D                               A
I came in like a wrecking ball
                       Bm              G
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
               D                       A
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
                             Bm  G
All you ever did was  break me
           Bm       G
Yeah, you wreck me
