[Verse]
D                             A
Hey, don't write yourself off yet.   
                           G
It's only in your head you feel left out
               D
or looked-down on.
              D                        A
Just try your best, try everything you can.  
                              G
And don't you worry what they tell themselves
             D
when you're away.
 
[Chorus]
        D                                                 
It just takes some time, 
                                 A
little girl you're in the middle of the ride.   
                            G                                      
Everything, everything will be just fine, 
                            D
everything, everything will be all right, all right
 
[Verse]
D                             A
Hey, you know they're all the same.  
                             G
You know you're doing better on your own
             D
so don't buy in.
                D                       A
Just live right now.  Yeah, just be yourself.  
                          G
It doesn't matter if it's good enough
            D
for someone else.
 
[Chorus x2]

[Verse]
D                             A
Hey, don't write yourself off yet.   
                           G
It's only in your head you feel left out
               D
or looked-down on.
              D                        A
Just try your best, try everything you can.  
                               G
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts
          D
are gonna say

[Chorus x2]
