[Verse 1]
        F#m
I found God
                 Dmaj7
I found him in a lover
         F#m
When his hair falls in his face
        Dmaj7
And his hands so cold they shake

            F#m
I found the Devil
                 Dmaj7
I found him in a lover
        F#m
And his lips like tangerine
       Dmaj7
In his colour coded speak

[Pre-Chorus]
          F#m                
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
     Dmaj7                
In a hotel room where demons play
     F#m         
They run around beneath our feet
   Dmaj7
We roll around beneath these sheets

[Chorus]
F#m
I've got a lover
  
a love like religion
Dmaj7
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

F#m
I've got a lover
and I'm unforgiving
Dmaj7
I'm such a fool to pay this price
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Verse 2]
          F#m
I found a martyr
                     D
He told me that he'd never
         F#m
With his educated eyes
        D
and his head between my thighs

          F#m
I found a savior
                   D
I don't think he remembers
            F#m
'Cause he's off to pay his crimes
         D
and he's got no time for mine

[Pre-Chorus]
          F#m                
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
     Dmaj7                
In a hotel room where demons play
     F#m         
They run around beneath our feet
   Dmaj7
We roll around beneath these sheets


[Chorus]
F#m
I've got a lover
  
a love like religion
Dmaj7
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

F#m
I've got a lover
and I'm unforgiving
Dmaj7
I'm such a fool to pay this price
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Bridge]
F#m                         D 
Every single night pray the sun will rise
A                        E 
Every single time make a compromise
F#m                         D 
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but

A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Chorus]
F#m
I've got a lover
  
a love like religion
Dmaj7
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

F#m
I've got a lover
and I'm unforgiving
Dmaj7
I'm such a fool to pay this price
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Bridge]
F#m                         D 
Every single night pray the sun will rise
A                        E 
Every single time make a compromise
F#m                         D 
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but

[Outro]
A 
It's coming down, down, coming down
E 
It's coming down, down, coming down

F#m D
A 
It's coming down, down, coming down
E 
It's coming down, down, coming down

F#m D
A
It's coming down, down, coming down
E
It's coming down, down, coming down
