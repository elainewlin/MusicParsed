[VERSE 1]
A                   E/G♯               F♯m
Let the bough break let it come down crashing
Dadd9            A             E/G♯
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
A                  E/G♯             F♯m
Can’t say I’d even notice it was absent
Dadd9                     A               E
Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
F♯m
I’ll unfold before you
Dadd9
What I’ve strung together
Bsus4                       Dadd9  Dm
The very first words of a lifelong love letter
[CHORUS]
A                      E/G♯                 F♯m
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
A                   E/G♯                 F♯m
I will become yours and you will become mine
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
                Dadd9           A                E/G♯
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oo / oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oose
You
A  E/G♯  F♯m  Dadd9  A  E
Oh, ohh, ohh Oh, ohh, ohh (or "Yeah…)
[VERSE 2]
A                     E/G♯              F♯m
There was a time when I would have believed them
        Dadd9             A              E/G♯
If they told me you could not come true, just love’s illusion
             A      E/G♯
But then you found me
    F♯m
and everything changed
    Dadd9        A             E
And I believe in something again
F♯m           Dadd9
My whole heart will be yours forever
Bsus4               Dadd9      Dm
This is a beautiful start to a lifelong love letter
[CHORUS]
A                      E/G♯                 F♯m
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
A                   E/G♯                 F♯m
I will become yours and you will become mine
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
                Dadd9           A                E/G♯
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oo / oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oose you
[BRIDGE]
F♯m                       Dadd9
We are not perfect we’ll learn from our mistakes
       A                       E/G♯
And as long as it takes I will prove my love to you
F♯m                     Dadd9
I am not scared of the elements I am underprepared
A
But I am willing
E
And even better, I get to be the other half of you
[CHORUS]
A                      E/G♯                F♯m
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou, yeah
A                   E/G♯                 F♯m
I will become yours and you will become mine
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
                Dadd9  A             E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
                Dadd9           A                E
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oo / oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oose you
