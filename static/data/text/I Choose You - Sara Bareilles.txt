[VERSE 1]

G                   D/F#               Em
Let the bough break let it come down crashing
Cadd9            G             D/F#
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
G                  D/F#             Em
Can’t say I’d even notice it was absent
Cadd9                     G               D
Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
Em
I’ll unfold before you
Cadd9
What I’ve strung together
Asus4                       Cadd9  Cm
The very first words of a lifelong love letter


[CHORUS]

G                      D/F#                 Em
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
                Cadd9  G             D
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
G                   D/F#                 Em
I will become yours and you will become mine
                Cadd9  G             D
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose yoo-oo-oo-oo-ou
                Cadd9           G                D/F#
I choo-oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oo / oo-oo-oo-oo / oo-oose

You

G  D/F#  Em  Cadd9  G  D
Oh, ohh, ohh Oh, ohh, ohh (or "Yeah…)


[VERSE 2]

G                     D/F#              Em  
There was a time when I would have believed them
        Cadd9             G              D/F#
If they told me you could not come true, just love’s illusion
             G      D/F# 
But then you found me 
    Em
and everything changed
    Cadd9        G             D
And I believe in something again
Em           Cadd9
My whole heart will be yours forever

This is a beautiful start to a lifelong love letter

We are not perfect we’ll learn from our mistakes 
       G                       D/F#
And as long as it takes I will prove my love to you
Em                     Cadd9

And even better, I get to be the other half of you
