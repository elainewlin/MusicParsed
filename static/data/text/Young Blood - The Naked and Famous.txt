Bb

[Verse]
Dm         C               Bb
We're only young and naive still
F      C           Bb    
We require certain skills
Dm          C                Bb
The mood it changes like the wind
F           C             Bb 
Hard to control when it begins

[Chorus]
F                            Bb     F
The bittersweet between my teeth
           C             Bb         F
Trying to find the in-betweens
                        Bb          F
Fall back in love eventually
         C        Bb
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse]
Dm              C                Bb
Can't help myself but count the flaws
F       C                        Bb            
Claw my way out through these walls
Dm        C     Bb
One temporary escape
F         C          Bb
Feel it start to permeate

Dm         C                 Bb
We lie beneath the stars at night
F            C                Bb
Our hands gripping each other tight
Dm           C               Bb
You keep my secrets hope to die
F          C                 Bb
Promises, swear them to the sky

[Chorus]
F                            Bb      F                         
The bittersweet between my teeth
           C             Bb          F
Trying to find the in-betweens
                          Bb         F
Fall back in love eventually
      C         Bb
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Bb F   C
      As it withers
Bb F   C
     Brittle it shakes
Bb F   C
   Can you whisper
Bb F   C              Bb  
   As it crumbles and breaks
F       C      Bb
As you shiver
F         C            Bb
Count up all your mistakes
F           C           Bb
Pair of forgivers
F          C             Bb
Let go before itâ€™s too late
F       C      Bb
Can you whisper
Can you whisper
Can you whisper
Can you whisper

[Chorus]
F                          Bb       F
The bittersweet between my teeth
          C               Bb        F
Trying to find the in-betweens
                         Bb         F
Fall back in love eventually
     C         Bb
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
