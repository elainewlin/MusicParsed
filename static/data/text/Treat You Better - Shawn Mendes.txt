[Intro x2]

Am G F 


[Verse 1]

Am      G         F
I won't lie to you
            Am        G           F
I know he's just not right for you
            Am
And you can tell me if I'm off
       G       
But I see it on your face
          F
When you say that he's the one that you want
            Am
And you're spending all your time
        G
In this wrong situation
     F
And anytime you want it to stop


[Chorus]
 
              Am        G    F
I know I can treat you better
            C  
Than he can
              Am         G          F      C                  
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                    Am
Tell me why are we wasting time
                 G
On all on your wasted crying
                F              C
When you should be with me instead
              Am         G     F
I know I can treat you better
C
Better than he can


[Verse 2]

Am         G          F
I'll stop time for you
               Am          G    F
The second you say you'd like me to
Am                          G      
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
F
Baby, just to wake up with you
         Am                        G                     
Could be everything I need and this could be so different
F
Tell me what you want to do


[Chorus]
                   Am          G    F
Cause I know I can treat you better 
           C
Than he can
                  Am     G       F         C 
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                    Am
Tell me why are we wasting time
                 G
On all on your wasted crying
                F            C
When you should be with me instead
              Am         G    F
I know I can treat you better  
C
Better than he can


[Bridge]

Am         G
Give me a sign
         C              F
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Am          G            F
Promise I won't let you down
Am                   G
Just know that you don't
        C         F
Have to do this alone
 Am              G         F
Promise I'll never let you down


[Chorus]
          
                    Am         G    F                
Cause I know I can treat you better
            C
Than he can
                  Am     G       F        C
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                     Am
Tell me why are we wasting time
                G
On all on your wasted crying
                F              C
When you should be with me instead
              Am         G     F
I know I can treat you better
Am G F C
      Better than he can
Am G F C
      Better than he can
Am G F C
      Better than he can
