A           G           F# 
I'm sick of picking the pieces 
          F            E           
And second guessing my reasons  
A              G                  
Why you don't trust me  
    F#         F           E            
Why must we do this to one another 

A           G          F# 
We are just passionate lovers 
             F         E             
With trouble under the covers 
A       G  
Nothing worse than when 
    F              E 
You know that it's over 

Em            D 
I just need a little of your time 
  Bm 
A little of your time 
   A 
To say the words I never said 
Em            D 
I just need a little of your time 
  Bm 
A little of your time 
   A 
To show you that I am not dead 
G                   Bb      Bm 
Please don't leave, stay in bed 
Bm               
Touch my body instead 
Em                          
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 
Em 
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it?   

A          G          F# 
Well I got nothing to hide 
    F                   E            
Dip down and come for a ride 
A         G          
Embrace a devil so sly 
F#          F        E       
You can not hear 'em coming 

A         G            F# 
'Cause my defenses are weak 
          F              E            
I have no breath left to speak 
   A        G  
So take the evidence 
    F       E 
And bury it somewhere 

Em            D 
I just need a little of your time 
  Bm 
A little of your time 
   A 
To say the words I never said 
Em            D 
I just need a little of your time 
  Bm 
A little of your time 
   A 
To show you that I am not dead 
G                   Bb      Bm 
Please don't leave, stay in bed 
Bm               
Touch my body instead 
Em                          
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 
Em 
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 

A  G           F# 
Oh my, I don't mind 
          F     E            
Being the other guy 
A    G              F#       
Nice try, for these games 
         F        E            
I do not have the time 
A      G        F# 
If you want me, call me 
F               E            
Come and take a risk 
A       G         F              E
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface 

Em            D 
I just need a little of your time 
  Bm 
A little of your time 
   A 
To say the words I never said 
Em            D 
I just need a little of your time 
  Bm 
A little of your time 
   A 
To show you that I am not dead 
G                   Bb      Bm 
Please don't leave, stay in bed 
Bm               
Touch my body instead 
Em                          
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 
Em 
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it?
