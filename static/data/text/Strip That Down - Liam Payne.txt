[Verse 1: Liam Payne]
                Am              C
You know, I've been taking some time
                F          C
And I've been keeping to myself (self)
          Am             C
I had my eyes up on the prize
       F                C
Ain't watching anybody else
          Am                   C
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
        F            C
Yeah, you're bad for my health
             Am                   C
I love the cards, that I've been dealt
        F               C
Do you feel the same as well?

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne & Quavo]
                          Am               C
You know, I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free)
                    F
People want me for one thing (that's not me)
Am                                        C
I'm not changing, the way, that I (used to be)
                   F             C
I just wanna have fun (and get rowdy)
                Am                C
One Coke and Bacardi (sippin' lightly)
                         F             C
When I walk inside the party (girls on me)
Am                       C
F1 type Ferrari (6 gear speed)
                           F              C
Girl, I love it when your body (grinds on me)
    F
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Quavo]
 Am
You know, I love it, when the music's loud
              C                Am
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby
                             C
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
          F                  C
But only you can dance with me
             Am          G
So put your hands on my body
     Dm                       C
And swing that round for me, baby (swing)
Am
You know, I love it when the music's loud
             C
But c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am
Oh, strip that down, girl
                         F                             Am

[Verse 2: Liam Payne]
C               Am             C
You know, that since the day, I met you
            F              C
Yeah, you swept me off my feet
               Am               C
You know, that I don't need no money
            F            C
When your love is beside me
            Am
Yeah, you opened up my heart
               F             C
And then you threw away the key
            Am              C
Girl, now it's just you and me
               F                      C
And you don't care 'bout, where I've been

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne & Quavo]
                          Am               C
