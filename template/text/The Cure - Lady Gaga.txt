Lady Gaga


[Verse 1]
Em                 G
I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
C         D
Cover you as you desire
Em             G               C   D
When you fall asleep inside my arms
Em               G
May not have the fancy things
C                 D
But I'll give you everything
Em             G                C   D
You could ever want, it's in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
D
So baby tell me yes
Em
And I will give you everything
C
So baby tell me yes
                  Em
And I will be all yours tonight
D
So baby tell me yes
Em                            C
And I will give you everything
D
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
Em7        C
If I can't find the cure,
Dsus4    G
I'll fix you with my love
Em7       C
No matter what you know, I'll
Dsus4    G
I'll fix you with my love
Em7        C
And if you say you're okay
Dsus4          G
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Em7     C
Promise I'll always be there
Dsus4   G
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)


[Verse 2]
Em             G
Rub your feet, your hands, your legs
C           D
Let me take care of it, babe
Em             G                         C   D
Close your eyes, I'll sing your favorite song
Em              G
I wrote you this lullaby
C              D
Hush now baby, don't you cry
Em           G                 C    D
Anything you want could not be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
D
So baby tell me yes
Em
And I will give you everything
C
So baby tell me yes
                  Em
And I will be all yours tonight
D
So baby tell me yes
Em                            C
And I will give you everything
D
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
Em7        C
If I can't find the cure,

No matter what you know, I'll
Dsus4    G
I'll fix you with my love
Em7        C
And if you say you're okay
Dsus4          G
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Em7     C
Promise I'll always be there
Dsus4   G
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)
