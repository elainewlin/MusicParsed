[Verse 1]

G
Right from the start
           C                  Em
You were a thief you stole my heart
    C                 G
And I your willing victim
G                                  C                     Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C                      G
And with every touch you fixed them
    Em                  A         D    G
Now you've been talking in your sleep  oh oh
Em               A      D   G
Things you never say to me  oh oh
Em                  A    D
Tell me that you've had enough
G      C     G   Dsus D
Of our love, our love


[Chorus]

G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            C
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                            D/F#                        Em
It's in the stars, It's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken just bent
           D              G
And we can learn to love again


[Verse 2]

   G                              C              Em
Im sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  C                    G
I thought that we were fine

(Oh we had everything)
     G                              C                 Em
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
    C               G
And its all in your mind

(Yeah but this is happening)
Em                 A        D       G
You've been having real bad dreams  Oh oh
    Em             A        D   G
You used to lie so close to me  Oh oh
        Em                A     D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  G         C     G   D/F#         C     G   D
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love


[Chorus]

G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            C
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                             D/F#                         Em
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                       Bm
You're not broken just bent
           D                  Em
And we can learn to love again


[Bridge]

Em                 D/F#
Oh tears ducts and rust
                C
I'll fix it for us
                 D
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
Em                D/F#
You're holding it in, You're pouring a drink
C                D      Dsus
No nothing is as bad as it seems

We'll come clean

[Chorus]

G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            C
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                             D/F#                         Em
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                       Bm
You're not broken just bent
           D                  Em
And we can learn to love again


[Chorus]

G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            C
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                            D/F#                        Em
It's in the stars, It's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken just bent
           D              G
And we can learn to love again


[Outro]

G  D/F#                    Em

      C       D              G
