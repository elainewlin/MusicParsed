            Am
There'll be girls across the nation
          E7
That will eat this up babe
  F                                      C         G
I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
    Am
Get down to the heart of it,
E7                           F
No it's my heart you're xxxx out of your luck
              C         G       Am               E7
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love.
F                C   G
Love love love love.
 
I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
With her delicate soul
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
To make room for the parts
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of
Love love love love
Love Love love love
 
Am          E7                    G
Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
      F
Worth trying to be and it's
 
[Chorus]
C     G     Am    F
Love, love, love, love

            C     G     Am    F
I do it for love, love, love, love

We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us
Oh, but sensible sells so could you kindly shut up
And get started
At keeping your part of the bargain aw please
Little darlin'
You're killing me sweetly with love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am          E7                    G
Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
      F
Worth trying to be and it's
 
[Chorus]
C     G     Am    F
Love, love, love, love

            C     G     Am    F
I do it for love, love, love, love
 
[Bridge]
             Am                   E7   
Started as a flicker meant to be a flame
                       G                D7   
Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
                  Dm                   A7   
Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall
                       C
Baby's getting next to nowhere with her back
 G
Against the wall.
                     Am           E7   
You meant to make me happy make me sad.
                       G        D7   
Want to make it better better so bad.
                  Dm              A7   
But save your resolutions for your never new year
                    C                G
There is only one solution I can see here.
 
Pre-[Chorus]
Am              E7                     G
Love you're all I ever could need only one good thing
      F
Worth trying to be and it's
 
[Chorus]
C     G     Am    F
Love, love, love, love
            C     G     Am    F
I do it for love, love, love, love
   C               G                  Am    F
Oh, only gonna get get what you give away,
C                G                  Am   F
Only gonna get get what you give away...love.
