[Verse 1]

Em                   Am     Em
      My lover's got humour
                      Am       G
She's the giggle at a funeral
                  Am          Em
Knows everybody's disapproval
                           Am      Em
I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am         Em
If the Heavens ever did speak
                     Am          G
She is the last true mouthpiece
                       Am          Em
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
               Am           D
A fresh poison each week
                   C/G
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
Em                          Am         Em
        My church offers no absolutes
                             Am        G
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                        Am        Em
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                  Am         D
Is when I'm alone with you
                 C/G
I was born sick, but I love it
C/G
     Command me to be well


[Verse 1]

G          C G   C G   Cm G
Aaaaaaaaaaamen. Amen. Amen

[Chorus x2]

G          Em
     Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
B                                                           G
       I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                            A G G F#
Good God, let me give you my life


[Verse 2]

Em                           Am          Em
       If I'm a pagan of the good times
               Am         G
My lover's the sunlight
                       Am        Em
To keep the Goddess on my side
              Am          D
She demands a sacrifice
                        C/G
To drain the whole sea
                     Em
Get something shiny
                        Am           Em
Something meaty for the main course
                      Am            G
That's a fine looking high horse
                    Am        Em
What you got in the stable?
                        Am         D
We've a lot of starving faithful
                  C/G
That looks tasty
                   C/G
That looks plenty
               G F#
This is hungry work


[Chorus x2]

G       Em
Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
B                                                          G
      I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                      A G G F#
Good God, let me give you my life               


 [Bridge]

C                  G              B         Em
     No masters or kings when the ritual begins
         C          G              B          Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
   C               G            B           Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C         G           B         Em
Only then I am human, only then I am clean.


[Pre-Chorus]
