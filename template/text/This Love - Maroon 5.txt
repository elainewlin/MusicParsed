[Verse 1]
G                      Cm
I was so high I didn't recognize
          Fm                                  G
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind....
G                            Cm
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
          Fm                           G
Never to return again but always in my heart
 
[Chorus]
Cm   Fm      Bb7         Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         Bb            Eb
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        Bb           Eb
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    Bb                Eb      G  -  Cm  -  Fm   -   G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore

G                      Cm
I tried my best to feed her appetite
          Fm                                  G
Keep her coming every night
G                            Cm
So hard to keep her satisfied
          Fm                           G
Kept playing love like it was just a game
G                      Cm
Pretending to feel the same
          Fm                           G
Then turn around and leave again
 
[Chorus]
Cm   Fm      Bb7         Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         Bb            Eb
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        Bb           Eb
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    Bb                Eb      G  -  Cm  -  Fm   -   G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore
 
[Bridge]
 Fm
I'll fix these broken things

Repair your broken wings

And make sure everything's alright

My pressure on your hips

Sinking my fingertips
G
Into every inch of you cause I know that's what you want me to do
