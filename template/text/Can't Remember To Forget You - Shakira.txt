[Verse 1]

Bm            Em
   I left a note on my bedpost
A                D
Said not to repeat
C#m
Yesterday's mistakes
Bm
What I tend to do
Em
When it comes to you
A               D
I see only the good
Bm
Selective memory
Bm
The way he makes me feel, yeah
Em
Gotta hold on me
            A                  D   
I've never met someone so different
Bm
Oh here we go
Bm
He a part of me now
Em
He a part of me
A
So where you go I follow, follow, follow


[Chorus]

Bm      A
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        Em
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        G           F#
I can't remember to forget you
Bm      A
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        Em
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        G                 F#
I keep forgetting I should let you go
Bm              A
   But when you look at me
         Em           G              F#
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Bm      A
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        Em
Oh, oh, oooh, oh

I can't remember to forget you


[Verse 2]

Bm
  I go back again
Em
  Fall off the train
A
  Land in his bed
D                  Bm
Repeat yesterday's mistakes

Bm                   Em
  What I'm trying to say is not to forget
A                      D           Bm
  You see only the good, selective memory
Bm
The way he makes me feel, yeah
Em
The way he makes me feel
         A               D      C#m
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
Bm
He a part of me now
Em
He a part of me
A
So where he goes I follow, follow


[Chorus]

Bm      A
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        Em
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        G           F#
I can't remember to forget you
Bm      A
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        Em
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        G                 F#
I keep forgetting I should let you go
Bm              A
   But when you look at me
         Em           G              F#
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Bm      A
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
        Em
Oh, oh, oooh, oh

I can't remember to forget you
