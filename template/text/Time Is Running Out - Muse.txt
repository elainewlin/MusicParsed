[Verse 1]
Am
I think I'm drowning
B
asphyxiated
E
I wanna break this spell
F            G
that you've created

Am
you're something beautiful
B
A contradiction
E
I wanna play the game
F           G
I want the friction

Am   B      E         F    G
you will be the death of me
Am   B      E         F    G
you will be the death of me


[Pre-Chorus 1]
F
bury it
G         Am           G
I won't let you bury it
F                    
I won't let you smother it
G         Am           G
I won't let you murder it


[Chorus 1]
F
our time is running out
G       Am            C
our time is running out
F
you can't push it underground
G       Am            F        G
you can't stop it screaming out




[Verse 2]
Am
I wanted freedom
B
bound and restricted
E
I tried to give you up
F         G
but I'm addicted

Am
now that you know I'm trapped
B
sense of elation
E
you'd never dream of
F         G
breaking this fixation

Am   B      E         F    G
you will squeeze the life out of me


[Pre-Chorus 2]
F
bury it
G         Am           G
I won't let you bury it
F                    
I won't let you smother it
G         Am           G
I won't let you murder it


[Chorus 2]
F
our time is running out
G       Am            C
our time is running out
F
you can't push it underground
G       Am           
you can't stop it screaming out
C
how did it come to this?
Dm           Am
oo-oo-ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dm           Am
oo-oo-ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dm           Am              E
oo-oo-ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!


[Verse 3]
Am   B      E         F    G
you will suck the life out of me


[Pre-Chorus 3]
F
bury it
G         Am           G
I won't let you bury it
F                    
I won't let you smother it
G         Am           G
I won't let you murder it


[Chorus 3]
F
our time is running out
G       Am            C
our time is running out
F
you can't push it underground
G       Am           
you can't stop it screaming out
C
how did it come to this?
Dm           Am
