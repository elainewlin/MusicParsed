Amaranth - Nightwish
[Verses]

Dm
Baptized with a perfect name
             Bb   C
The doubting one by heart
                   Dm
Alone without himself
Dm
War between him and the day
             Bb C
Need someone to blame
                          Dm
In the end, little he can do alone
Gm                       Dm
You believe but what you see
Gm                        Eb
You receive but what you give
Dm         Bb             F
Caress the one, the Never-Fading
C       Dm   Bb                   F          C
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Dm         Bb              F
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
C         Bb     Eb
In a land of the daybreak
Dm
Apart from the wandering pack
        Bb            C
In this brief flight of time we reach
                 Dm
For the ones, whoever dare
Gm                       Dm
You believe but what you see
Gm              Eb
You receive but what you give
Dm         Bb             F
Caress the one, the Never-Fading

Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow

Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Dm         Bb              F
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
C         Bb     Eb
In a land of the daybreak

Reaching, searching for something untouched
