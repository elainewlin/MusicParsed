[Verse]

      A#                         F
Get hot Get too close to the flame

               Gm                              
Wild open space  
                  D#   
Talk like an open book

        A#       
Sign me up  
                       F
Got no time to take a picture

                 Gm    
I'll remember someday            

                    D#
All the chances we took


[Pre-Chorus]

           D#    
We're so close 

                           F
to something better left unknown

          D#
We're so close 

                           F
to something better left unknown


[Chorus]

                    Gm
I can feel it in my bones

D#
Gimme 

        A#
sympathy

F                       
After all 

         Gm
this is gone

D#       
Who would you 

        A#
rather be

     F  
The Beatles or 

            Gm
The Rolling Stones?

D#
Oh 

        A#
seriously

        F                         D#
You're gonna make mistakes you're young


[Post-Chorus]

A#               
Come on baby 

        F
play me something,

F                   D#          
Like here comes the sun


A#               
Come on baby 

        F
play me something,

F                    Gm
Like here comes the sun

(Gm)


[Verse 2]

      A#
Don't go

                     F
Stay with the all unknown
                  
                   Gm
Stay away from the hooks
                
                    D#
All the chances we took


[Pre-Chorus]

          D#                                  F
We're so close to something better left unknown

          D#                                  F
We're so close to something better left unknown

 
[Chorus]

                     Gm
I can feel it in my bones

D#            A#
Gimme sympathy

F                 Gm
After all this is gone

D#                    A#
