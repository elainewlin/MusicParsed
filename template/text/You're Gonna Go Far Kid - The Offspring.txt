[Verse 1]

Am
Show me how to lie
                F
you’re getting better all the time
             C
And turning all against the one
       G
is an art that’s hard to teach
Am
Another clever word
             F
sets off an unsuspecting herd
            C
and as you step back into line
        G
A mob jumps to their feet

     Am
Now dance fucker dance
        F
man he never had a chance
        C
And no one even knew
        G
it was really only you


[Pre-chorus]

             F
And now you steal away
          Dm
take him out today
      Fsus2
Nice work you did
                 Dm7
you’re gonna go far, kid


[Chorus]

        Am                  F
With a thousand lies and a good disguise
         C
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
         G
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
         Am                 F
when you walk away,nothing more to say
         C
See the lightning in your eyes
         G
See ‘em running for their lives


[Verse 2]

Am
Slowly out of line
              F
and drifting closer in your sights
            C
So play it out I’m wide awake
        G
it’s a scene about me
         Am
There’s something in your way
         F       
and now someone's gonna pay
            C
And if you can’t get what you want
           G
well it’s all because of me

     Am   
Now dance fucker dance
       F
man I never had a chance
        C
And no one even knew
        G
it was really only you


[Pre-Chorus]

                F
And now you’ll lead the way
          Dm
show the light of day
      Fsus2
Nice work you did
                 Dm7        
You’re gonna go far, kid

Trust, deceived


[Chorus]

        Am                  F
With a thousand lies and a good disguise
         C
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
         G
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
          Am                 F 
When you walk away, nothing more to say
         C
See the lightning in your eyes
         G
See ‘em running for their lives


[Bridge]

     Am
Now dance fucker dance
     F
he never had a chance
        C
And no one even knew
        G
it was really only you

    Am
So dance fucker dance
    F
I never had a chance
        C              G
it was really only you


[Chorus]

        Am                  F
With a thousand lies and a good disguise
         C
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
         G
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
          Am                F
When you walk away nothing more to say
         C
See the lightning in your eyes
         G
See ‘em running for their lives


[Outro]

        Am           F
Clever alibis, lord of the flies
         C
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
         G
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
          Am                F
When you walk away nothing more to say
         C
See the lightning in your eyes
         G
See ‘em running for their lives
