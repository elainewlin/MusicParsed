Am, C, D, Am, C, D

[Verse]
Am            C 
After school, walkin home
D
Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
Am          C   
I can smell hot asphalt
D 
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
Am        C
And I cannot remember
D
What life was like through photographs
Am          C           D                       
And trying to recreate images life gives us from the past

Am C
                    D
And sometimes its a sad song.  But I

[Chorus]
F          C                Am 
Cannot forget, refuse to regret
          G 
So glad I met you and
F                C
Take my breath away
          Am
Make everyday
                 G
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
F
And mama, I've been cryin'
      Am                        G
Cause things ain't how they used to be
               F
She said, 'The battle's almost won
          Dm            E               Am C
And we're only several mi-les from the sun.'
     D          Am      C D
O-wo-ho-o-o-o-o-oh, yeah

[Verse]
       Am        C
And I'm movin on, down my street
D
I see people I won't ever meet
Am
I think of her, take a breath
D                                  Am
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

Am C
                    D
And sometimes its a sad song.  But I

[Chorus]
F          C                Am 
Cannot forget, refuse to regret
          G 
So glad I met you and
F                C
Take my breath away
          Am
Make everyday
                 G
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
F
And mama, I've been cryin'
      Am                        G
Cause things ain't how they used to be
               F
She said, 'The battle's almost won
          Ddim            E               Am C
And we're only several mi-les from the sun.'

[Bridge]
Am
Rhythm of the conversation
E7
The perfection of her creation
Am
The sex she slipped into my coffee
E7    
The way she felt when she first saw me
Am
Hate to love and love to hate her
E7
Like a broken record player
Am
Back and forth and here and gone
    E7
and on and on and on and on!

[Chorus]
F          C                Am 
Cannot forget, refuse to regret
        G 
So glad I met you and
F                C
Take my breath away
          Am
Make everyday
                 G
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
F
And mama, I've been cryin'
    Am                        G
Cause things ain't how they used to be
             F
She said, 'The battle's almost won
        D            E            
And we're only several mi-i-i-iles 
         F
Said, 'The battle's almost won
         D            E               Am C 
And we're only several mi-les from the sun.'
  D      Am
Yea-A...-A-ah
