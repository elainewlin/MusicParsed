F#m                        D
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
    A                  E
It's Friday night and I won't be long

Gotta do my hair, I put my make-up on
    A                  E

I got all I need
    F#m
No I ain't got cash
D
No I ain't got cash
A              E
But I got you baby


[Chorus]

    F#m            D                   A

As long as I keep dancing
