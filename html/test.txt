C
We were both young when I first saw you 
F
I close my eyes and the flashback starts 
Am                       F
Im standing there on a balcony of summer air 

C
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns 
       F
I see you make your way through the crowd 
          Am
You say hello 
            G
Little did I know 


[Pre-Chorus]

           F                      G
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles 
          Am                       C
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet 
            F
And I was crying on the staircase 
  G                      Am F     G
Begging you please don't go, and I said 


[Chorus]

  C
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone 
 G
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run 
 Am
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess 
 F                G                 C
Its a love story baby just say yes 


[Verse 2]

   C
So I sneak out to the garden to see you 
F
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew 
              Am
So close your eyes 
                       G
Escape this town for a little while 


[Pre-Chorus]

       F                      G
'Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter 
         Am                        C
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet 
         F
But you were everything to me I was
  G                      Am  F   G
Begging you please don't go, and I said


[Chorus]

 C
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone 
 G
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run 
 Am
You be the prince i'll be the princess 
 F                G
Its a love story baby just say yes 

  C
Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
  G
This love is difficult, but it's real, 
  Am
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
 F                G 
Its a love story baby just say yes, oh


[Solo] 

C  G  Am  F G


[Bridge]

                 Am     F               C                         G
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around 
                   Am      F
My faith in you was fading
       C                             G
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said 


[Chorus]

C
Romeo save me i've been feeling so alone 
G
I keep waiting for you but you never come 
    Am
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think 
   F                       G
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

  D
Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone 
   A
I love you, and that's all I really know 
   Bm
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
 G                 A          D
Its a love story baby just say yes 


[Outro]

D  A      Bm
uh Oh, uh oh, yes 
         G                           D
We were both young when I first saw you
